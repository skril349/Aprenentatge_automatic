{"text":"I went to this location because it's easy to get in and out even tho it is a busy corner. This is my second visit. My first visit was mediocre. The woman who assisted me was not really friendly (sorry I didn't get names at either visit) but was helpful and professional. My second visit I was assisted by a different woman who was also helpful, knowledgeable and professional. I realized the women were not being rude; they are just quiet. Neither woman made small talk but answered every question I had. \nNow my second visit deserved 5 stars. I normally pack things myself and just need it shipped, but I was shipping a skateboard and could not box it correctly. The woman went above and beyond to help me and she offered more assistance than was professionally required.  I will return to this location for all my shipping needs.\nThe store is clean, and packs (no pun intended) a lot of product into a small space. The staff is knowledgeable. They have boxes, packing materials, and offer copying services. You may not get a big smile and a lot of small talk, but you will get the highest level of service. In my opinion.","stars":5}
{"text":"It's just a place to get my mail. \nIt's about $250.00 per year for a little box.  it makes sense for us because we travel so much.

I get a phone call every time I receive one.  \nI would rather ship out my parcels using Fed-ex because they are cheaper and more reliable.   \nMy husband has used their printing services and is happy with them. \nI see packaging materials and other stationary goods for sale, but I prefer to use Canada Post for that.\nNo problem with the staff.  They are cheerful and helpful.  They know me well.\nThe strip mall location can be a little sketchy.  Some druggies and homeless people like to hang out at the neighbouring store fronts.","stars":3}

This UPS store took my styrofoam that was included with a television set I had recently purchased.  \n\nStore:\nThe store is quite clean.  A little on the small size, but I think more than adequate for the services they offer.   \n\nThe person I mainly interact with at the store is a gentleman that I believe is the owner.  He has always been fairly pleasant.  I must admit, I get a sense that shipping prepaid packages is not really valued, and so getting \"moved along\" through the process is paramount.","stars":3}

My documents were on a flash drive and when we pulled it up on the computer in the back, the formatting was all messed up and they let me work on it until it was ready to go to print.  We printed it out, my documents looked great, and I was out of there in no time!  The next day, an event arose and I was in need an even larger printing order but had no time to run over there again and wait for it to print.  I tried submitting an order online via the UPS website but it would't process it because there wasn't enough notice.  I emailed the store directly, they remembered me and told me it was not going to be a problem.  I emailed them my order and it was ready for me as soon as I walked through the door.

I have mailed packages from this location many times and always had a good experience.

{"text":"I used to maintain a mailbox here and the customer service has been fantastic. Prior to the Kayla, Richard, Sebastian, and Torie, customer service there had been...less than what I had expected. After the new staff was in place, I was always greeted with a smile and by my name. It was such a wonderful change from before. \n\nThe reason for this review though is that I ran into a small problem with a different UPS Store across the country. I did dropped off a package for a textbook return, and Amazon said they never received it. Since I couldn't get any help from them, I turned to the staff at this UPS store since they never let me down before. I got Kayla on the phone, and she said she would call the UPS Store I went to last and see what she could do. She called me back not too long after that the other store had not scanned in the package and just set it into the back where it was picked up. I was still out of luck but at least they did more to help me than the other store did! \n\nIn the background, I heard someone suggest that I should contact Amazon (I later found out that the suggestion came from Richard), and I did that! Amazon refunded me the cost of my textbook even though they never received it, and they deemed it lost. All in all, I just wanted to thank the staff at this store for going above and beyond to help me. Since I wasn't even a customer at the store anymore, nor did I send it from their location I didn't expect them to be much help but they exceeded my expectations!\n\nSo thank you again! If I move back to Reno, I will definitely make this my one and only UPS Store. \n\nP.S.: If a store offers you a drop off receipt, I suggest taking one based on my own experiences.","stars":5}

It's always so nice to come into this UPS store and have no issues dropping off my return packages. I usually go during my lunch hour and rarely have issues with lines here. I've been helped a few times by Lisa and she is always so helpful, always seals my packages for me and prints me a tracking receipt for my records. In fact, all the workers I've interacted with at this UPS location have been nothing but helpful.

The item was supposed to arrive that Friday before 8pm. \n\nI stayed home that evening, and at 10pm Friday night, the package had still not been delivered. I tracked the package online, and found the following comment: \"Customer was not available when UPS attempted delivery. Will deliver to a nearby UPS Access Point for customer pick up.\"  When I checked the front door of my condo building, there was a delivery notice stuck to the door. However, at NO TIME WAS A DELIVERY ATTEMPT MADE! I can prove this since my phone is linked to the building intercom, and my phone records show no call from the intercom for the time period in question. \n\nThe kicker is that the package now had to be picked up from this UPS Store THE NEXT WEEKDAY, which was the following Tuesday. So much for next day delivery, let alone delivery at all.

When I'm sending UPS it's generally a drop off (prepaid).  A few times now the people behind the counter are either put out for having to do it or tell me that receipts aren't available for drop off (wholly untrue).\n\n2. The most recent experience had me dropping off a box for a return.  It was after 5PM so I knew the package would go out the next day.  The only problem was it didn't go out the next day.  It went out 8 days later.    Unfortunately (for me) the package was supposed to be at it's destination within a certain time frame. I now find myself fighting a $599 charge because the recipient didn't receive the package on time (had my package actually gone out the following day it would have had 6 days to get to its destination (it was sent 3 day select).\n\nThanks UPS store 5314!","stars":2}
{"text":"Shipped a package from here to back home in Wisconsin.  Item arrived busted.  It was a Christmas gift.  Employees were friendly however now that the package is going through the claims process - they have gone off the radar ignoring my emails to this store, to the manager, Ms. Willis.  I emailed her on the 8th of Feb and the 16th of Feb.  Neither got a response.  Clearly it appears to me - they don't want to do any more lifting on dealing with the issue with UPS.  Never mind the item broken was $90 from Sarasota Salvage - an architech salvage store that I had to drive to twice with regards to this issue.  Add in the cost of shipping of approx $30.  Add in my sister's efforts to keep leaving the damaged box outside her house and on top of that my brother in law drove the box to the UPS station in Milwaukee only to be told, they would not accept the damaged box there.  I kept getting bounced between corporate and the UPS Store.  It didn't seem either knew what the other was doing.  The UPS driver in Milwaukee took 2 weeks to pick up the box.  I've probably got $300 or more dollars of my time and money into this and still nobody has done anything to resolve the matter.  Considering my shipping options are Fedex and the hopeless postal service, I'm pretty much high and dry.   Next step will be filing a complaint with BBB.  I'm guessing UPS has more damaged boxes during Christmas than any time of year so they try to deny as many claims as possible to keep their costs down.  Think about it, you have drivers doing more volume than any time of year, they're out there hustling and probably throwing the boxes around more than usual, hence more broken items.  That's just my personal theory.  I normally go out of my way to compliment good businesses, this doesn't appear to be one of them worthy of that praise yet.","stars":2}

I asked if USPS had tracking, she replied yes.  So I did the transaction.\n\nTuesday.....No package\n\nWednesday.... I called the store and then I was told that the postman had already did the Monday pickup before I got there at 1526hrs so it id not go out until Tuesday evening, TORI did not tell me that at time of transaction.\nSo I called UPS Store Corp office to talk to them. They seemed puzzled too.\n\nThurday.....No Package.   I did get a call from Kayla saying they were looking into what Tori story was and they would call me back on Friday or Saturday.\n\nFriday.... My son finally got his meds.  No call from Kayla.\n\nSaturday....No call from Kayla\n\n\nI wish that i could post my paperwork to show the dates, but it turns out that my next day package to my son (which is shown on my paperwork) took 4 days to be delivered.  Even with the postman pick up not being until Tuesday, it is still 3 days. \n\nWhen my son got his meds on Friday, he took a photo of the shipping label.  The shipping label shows Priority Mail Express 2-day. \n\nSo with mistakes that Tori made by not informing of just about anything of importance, my son waited more than I had paid for.  \n\nEnd the end, if I would have known that the postman had already did his pickup on Monday, or knowing that overnight was really 2 day, I would have taken my package to FEDEX Kinkos Office  on South Virginia....THEY ARE ALWAYS RELIABLE\n\nI am still waiting to hear from anybody at the local store on their findings with Tori, but I always thought the customer is always right and the paperwork they provided does not lie.  \n\nI am hoping for a refund due to the fact that Tori made a big mistake which caused a medical issue for my son.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWhile Kayla said she would call me back......never did. LIED??  maybe\n\nI did get an update from UPS Store Corp Customer Service...\nTori told the investigator that she did tell me a few time about the pick-up time. LIE, LIE, LIE. So no refund from the store, but gosh I hate lying !!!!!\n\nCalled Zhong the franchise owner, he stated that he does not even train his employees with regards to telling the customer the pick-up date.  \n\nI believe that most of us expect the pick-up date is the same as the Drop-off date.

{"text":"BUYER BEWARE! I used to use this UPS store all the time because it's right by my house but I have been here twice this week to ship a few golf clubs as I clear out my collection for the upcoming season. First time I walked out without shipping anything because they quoted me 3 times the normal price for shipping a golf club even though the golf club was only going to Tennessee(I have shipped many over the years and this was by FAR the highest I have every been quoted). I asked if the dimensions were entered correctly and the blonde male cashier rolled his eyes, let out a sigh while he double checked. Price was correct per their system so I left and went down the street to FedEx(less than a mile west on Watson) and got both clubs I needed shipped for less than what this UPS wanted for 1. Figured it may have been a fluke since I have used them before without issue so I went back today to ship a shaft that should have cost no more than $12 to ship(42 inch 1.5 inch tube weighing less than 2 pounds) and ended up paying more than $20. This place has decided to up their prices for whatever reason(free market right) but if you are like me and don't want to pay more for same service I suggest the FedEx down the road.","stars":2}

UPS pricing fits my current budget, so decided to switch.  I asked for one copy of 15 photo samples that were printed on one of their color copiers that apparently isn't serviced on a regular basis as there were streak lines across the top of the majority of my images.  When I pointed this out to Dennis, the owner, he got indignant with me and chided me for asking for 15 copies.  There are other shipping businesses that provide the same kind of print services that UPS banner signs state that the company offers.  And I never had any problems with the print quality prior to using this UPS store.  And the colors always looked exactly the way that they appeared on my screen.  I wouldn't give this store even one star if it weren't for the fact that Yelp requires it.","stars":1}

I've never seen such insulting and pathetic customer service experience as such. It's amazing how A she had the store closed earlier then they should ( no power issues or anything of that sort ) B she had the courage to ask of me to pay $10 for a box!!!!!

I mentioned to the employee that I had an item to be shipped using the CRS prepayment, which includes packaging and shipping.Which is basically where you can drop an item to UPS, they pack and ship it with no out of pocket payment due at drop off. The company reimburses the ups store.  Anywho, the rep servicing me advised there was no such thing and that I would need to pay for the packaging costs of $11.  I kept reiterating to him the service I had.  And then I asked him, ok what exactly would you need me to provide you to know that this payment is covered by a reimbursement that was prearranged.  He said I'd need actual money.  It was such an aggravating experience.  I finally found actual instructions online for me to relay to him and code and system for him to use to NOT charge me to packing and shipping the item.  And he was very familiar with the procedure as he asked me no follow up question when I told him to use the CMS? system etc. It was like he was withholding the information from me.  Thankfully I found the instructions to provide HIM to do HIS job. But it wasnt a pleasant experience. Won't be going back.","stars":1}

{"text":"I have gone to this store to drop off returns for a few years. It's close and usually quick. Today there was a line and the two people ahead of me had business to conduct and were slower than me with my simpler pickup. I was fine with that because I was waiting inside, though I was hungry, having scheduled my lunch hour around the pickup of one piece of paper I needed to be printed on cardstock. \nI was told it wasn't ready. This surprised me as I'd placed the order nearly 24 hours before and I thought online said it would be ready in the morning. The employee said she hadn't had time to do it because she'd worked late and had been busy this morning. I have since checked my email and the pickup time is 1:30 and I was a little over an hour early for it. But I doubt it would have been done by then and because the store was pretty busy this lunch hour. I was told that I'll get a phone call when it's ready if I left a phone call online when I placed the order. I asked when it might be ready and she said she'd get to it when she could, or something like that. Well, I left and got food and went on with my life.\nI know it seems like a small thing, but it's one piece of paper and I scheduled my lunch hour around it and now I'll get to repeat the driving and waiting tomorrow if it is indeed ready by then. Fed Ex did a job in like 2 hours once...\nOne star for cute emotional support dog!\n\nUPDATE: Yesterday afternoon (shortly after I tried to pick up the paper), I got an email saying that the status of my order had changed. I clicked the link, but it led to a file not found or one of those type errors. Tried several more times and on a different device. Still didn't work. I received an email from an actual person saying that they couldn't call me because the phone number on my order was the phone number of their store. What the... Anyway, it was ready, the employee was VERY nice, and they even threw in a second copy of the item on a piece of paper, which will be handy when the old one gets aged (it's going to be displayed on a wall). So I'm good now because I got it before the deadline. \nI'll take my paper printing business elsewhere--I'm getting the feeling that it is the UPS system that has problems vs. it being a human problem, but it's still a problem--and I haven't had a problem with FedEx (though there's a first time for everything, isn't there?). If you get something printed, wait until they say it's done before you try to pick it up. \nDefinitely do your returns here. I like that dog.","stars":3}

They were durable, and I bubble wrapped everything, but I got insurance just in case because some of the items were very expensive.  \n\nMost of the boxes arrived fine, but a couple of boxes had many broken items.  Unfortunately, these were expensive items too: a $300 juicer for example.  When I tried to claim insurance they told me they couldn't honor the claim because they couldn't inspect the boxes, and even if they did, it probably wouldn't be honored anyway because I packed the boxes myself and they have many rules about all objects being at least 2 inches from the side of the box etc.  \n\nJust wanted to warn anyone who is thinking about shipping expensive items.

That's how you provide customer service? I am minding my own business, and you pester me continually. Is business that bad? Not my problem.\n\nwhy did I take this to yelp?

The people in line were all ladies and we chatted -finally, after 20 minutes, the woman at the front of the line stepped in the store and asked if there were additional people that could assist. The lone staff,\"Leo\" was rude -raising his voice telling the woman to be patient. Honestly, he came across as pompous. Then he went off on her about not wearing a mask. Some man in the store seemed to be egging him on. The woman was wearing a mask and just pulled it down so to be heard. She was in the doorway and at least 20 feet from the counter. We stood outside for 10 minutes noting the line wasnt moving. Really Come on UPS store- hire contempt staff. Also, I notice Leonardo has an earlier negative Yelp review..just sayin'","stars":1}

{"text":"This is the worst store I have ever been to or have dealt with. If I could give 0 stars I would. In June I moved from Saint Louis to California and instead of using a moving company I decided to ship 6-7 boxes to myself through this store. Upon arriving, I received no help with the boxes from my car and was clearly struggling as a female in a store with 3-4 male employees. Little did I know this would be the least of my worries. Once I started the process, I realized the owner was the one helping me. He rang up each box individually and it ended up taking 1.5-2 hours. While he did tell me I could pay more for more insurance coverage he did not alert me to the fact that he could re-package some fragile items or that the process of me receiving money for damaged goods would be this horrific. Fast forward to June 13 and I receive all of my packages. All of the boxes I received were packaged HORRIBLY. There were holes and no fragile writing on the ones that needed care. I noticed so many damaged items but decided they were not worth reporting except for the one box I received with my 14 mugs. All of which were COMPLETELY broken. I called to report a claim and it has been 2 months of me playing telephone and being shoved off. I have called almost every week to try to get insurance on my mugs and have been told to \"call back\" or that \"it would be handled\". I even overheard the owner tell his employee that I was lying and he was annoyed by me while he thought I was on hold. I am so infuriated with this process and have called corporate to report this store who has then called the store and STILL it has been over 2 months with no progress. I do not have time to spend 4-5 hours a week calling UPS for a simple solution. I am at the end of my rope and will NEVER use UPS to ship again, nor will I recommend it to any of my friends.","stars":1}

{"text":"I love that this UPS Store has it's own corner lot. While this corner is quite busy and you have to be careful getting in and out of the UPS, it makes it easier to pull up and take care of your mailing needs quickly. \n\nI had to stop in at the beginning of December to drop off some textbook rentals that needed to be mailed back. We were there when they opened and the entire process was quick, easy and friendly. \n\nThe only reason why I am docking a star is because they are missing the UPS drop off box outside that would have made this process even easier. My textbooks had prepaid shipping and I did not need to do more than drop the box off. So, it could have been done without exiting my car and in the middle of the night if they had a drop box.","stars":4}
{"text":"I came here last week to drop off my dvr's to return to AT&T.  I returned today to ship additional equipment.  \n\nThere are various sized boxes displayed outside the front door.

Each time, an employee greeted me professionally and inquired how he could be of service.  And each time, I was helped efficiently and quickly without any hiccups.  They apparently can service most any kind of shipping need, mail services like post office boxes, and even shredding contents (I think he told me for $1/lb of material).  \n\nIt was nice to know about the shredding service because sometimes I fill several paper bags with confidential information and get overwhelmed to shred it myself.

All is well with the service, etc.  They have a posting on their door for all to see that a mask is required to enter the store and if you do not have a mask, please come back when you do.  A UPS driver walked into the store w/o a mask, then out again (walked right by me) then he came back in, stood in the back next to another driver with a mask and talked to employees all the time this guy did not have on a mask.  He was standing around for what I assumed was the final packages.  \nSo, I asked \"Leonardo\" why this driver didn't have on a mask when the sign clearly states that \"if you enter the store, you must be wearing a mask\".  Leonardo's response back to me was \"Oh, he doesn't work here, he works at the warehouse\".  My response back, \"It's your store, you have a sign that states masks are required... why is this guy allowed into the store\".  Leonardo didn't respond.  I realize it's \"uncomfortable\" to confront someone, so is contracting COVID.  This is disappointing & employees need better training.  It made me uncomfortable needed to say something.  I'm the customer, I should have a safe and pleasant experience.","stars":1}

I was desperate, and by long shot decided to try arranging the transaction through the ups store that can handle the packing and shipping to me. Jerome even agreed to help me pay the seller since the amount was so low. Talk about going above and beyond for someone he hasn't even met! I thought this was a sealed deal- how easy for the seller to go drop off the item and pick up his money, no leaking his personal info anywhere. Didn't even need to provide his name, only mine, but sadly it was still too much work for the seller and it didn't work out :(\n\nBottom line is this place is as awesome as the reviews say, and I'd definitely reach out again if such similar transaction were to occur in the future.

I purchased a box while I was there as I had one more item to ship and it was smaller than a flat rate USPS box. It's a small box - maybe 6\"x4\"x2.\" It was over $3. Just for the box. \n\nThat's so expensive for a small cardboard box. Definitely not worth the cost as it was still $9 to ship on top of that. For less I can get a flat rate shipping box through the USPS where I don't have to pay for the box itself.\n\nAside from the prices for shipping and supplies this is a great spot to drop off pre-paid packages.

I went back in to see what my options were and not only was she able to assist but she even helped me with the research to change my return order so she could scan my barcode and print it out without having to charge me additional! Thank you! Lots of kudos! She really has given me a much better impression of the company, which lately has not been the best. She is an asset to the team! Customer service and an honest helpful friendly face is worth the weight in gold to a company.","stars":5}
{"text":"Carla returned a Christmas gift sent on 12/22/2020 back across the country. There was only 1 attempt to deliver the box to the resident. This note left by the driver says we could pick up at this location. When I checked the APP the box was sent back to shipper and refused by this location right at Christmas. Carla is definitely a Grinch that stole Christmas. No one can find the box now! Since 12/22/2020!! Very sad!! Per Carla it's corporate fault and vice versus. All frustrating and I still do not have a box or anyone at UPS has submitted a claim for us to be reimbursed!! Very shameful and Carla have a very bad attitude for someone that was unwilling to hold the box and just sent it back. I sent it signature required. I rather they just left on the porch than go through this ever again or deal with Carla again!","stars":1}

One time I dropped off a package to ship only later to realize that I forgot to put something very critical inside. I called and the counter person was extremely awesome and located my package, and saved it from being shipped out that night! I feel confident that I can drop my packages off here and they will be treated with care and routed appropriately.\n\nOnce you go to this UPS a few times, you get used to the weird confusing parking lot and entrance thing, and it's no longer a big deal.","stars":5}

{"text":"What a bunch off ripoff artists.  Everything they sell from pack and ship to shipping services is priced about 4 times what is fair and appropriate. They looked me in the eye and said that a 2 day letter would cost over $50 to deliver. Then they expected 9 for a small box and some packing peanuts. When I balked at those prices they offered the USPS service that costs about $8... For $19. \n\nI'm not opposed to a business making a profit but that is excessive. Considering how much they must be making off of Amazon returns I'm astounded that they mark up at all. \n\nI took everything to the USPS and paid $12 for the same results.","stars":1}

The owner, the staff everyone is so mean and hostile. I just asked to see if they pasted the return label correctly or not and the lady at the counter got all ballistic on me saying' you should have better pasted it on your own'. Gee if I am paying for the service I sure would want to make sure that things are done properly. \n\nP.S. Always bring sealed boxes because you will not want to be charged 75cents extra for every box that they seal(this store's policy) and better not ask why they do so because the owner will jump in and get all angry and hostile towards you.

{"text":"Although I make it a point of avoiding this store (see my previous review on the topic), an employee of mine chose to ship our clients' Christmas gifts using this business' services. We had 19 packages going to 19 different people. Some of these people were at the same business address. When trying to send them, the worker indicated there were other customers and entering that many takes time, so the packages were left and when my employee returned the next day, she was told they were done and given the shipment receipts for each one.\n\nIn reviewing the shipment receipts, I noticed that the ship-to name was not updated when sending to the same address such that one person at a business would get, for example, all four packages being shipped there. This is a problem since the packages are customized per recipient and some of the recipients don't know the other ones. \n\nWhen bringing this to the store's attention, my employee was told to pick up the phone and call the contacts to let them know which gift should go to which person. So, instead of taking any responsibility whatsoever for the problem he caused, he suggested that we and our clients be inconvenienced.\n\nCan't make this stuff up! Easier to use UPS shipping services at Staples in Manoa Shopping Center than this place! You'd think for a business that supposedly specializes in shipping that they'd be able to get that right.","stars":1}

From the moment my daughter (13) and I walked in the door, the guy behind the counter was angry and copping serious attitude and made our experience very uncomfortable. He was intent on making things difficult for us as he measured and priced our package...and we ended up leaving without shipping our items because of him. Very uncomfortable and a bit of a hostile environment this morning that he created there. \n\nP.S. - this UPS store wanted to charge us $803 in total ($50 for packing and $753 to ship to Arizona for Tues delivery). After we left, we went to FedEx across the street and they packed and shipped for same speed of delivery for a total of only $190 ($15 for packing and $175 for shipping)!","stars":1}

We shipped a Christmas gift that arrived at her store on 12/22/2020 because no one was home. She refused the box and sent it back to shipper so she says. To date 1/31/2021 the box still can't be found or traced in the UPS system!! Nor will they honor their $100 guarantee!! What a grinch, thieves, bad business I could go on. I did read on Yelp this store had deceptive practices with someone else and tried to say the person had the wrong store. I certainly have the right store and I'm sure the other commenter did also!! Carla should be personally liable for the things that go on under the UPS name. I'm appalled by UPS not recognizing they have an issue with this location, owner. They have enough proof! Yelp should have a way to give no stars. I hate to give this store even 1 star!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"I wish I could give less than 1 star. This place is such a fraud, and The owner or manager whatever he is, Don is an actual robber. I am a small business owner trying to support local and give me business to the community but this man is outright ornery. I send large batches of items with the same exact things in them frequently. The first time he charged me $1.90 per package to which the items were kicked back. Which was fine. I brought them back and explained I think we need more postage. He then yelled at me explaining that this wasn't his fault and he thought this might happen. I am 6 months pregnant, so to be yelled at in a public establishment like this is enough to send me into tears. I was shocked. We got that situation straightened out, he apologized for the way he spoke to me and ultimately I paid $3.30 per package. \n\nFast forward to a week later and I decide to give him another chance, assuming he wants my business of course. He welcomes me by saying thanks for coming back and he appreciated me giving them another chance, and they'll get it right this time. Same package, same exact weight, same items. He tries to charge me $4.70 per package!!!!!! I was SHOCKED. He tells me that the last time he was \"doing me a favor to get me out of the store.\" Again, SHOCKED. Who says that to a customer? He immediately corrected himself and said he didn't mean to say to \"get me out of the store.\" \n\nI asked how he expects me to pay over a dollar more for the same exact packages? And politely asked what his markup was? To which he replied, \"he has to make money too.\" Again, SHOCKED. I asked again how much the markup was and he refused to give me an answer. \n\nI highly recommend visiting the post office, where they charged me $3.30 per package just as I paid the first time. When I wasn't completely robbed and taken advantage of. The staff at the post office was also shocked by my experience- and was so polite and helpful In getting my packages out. \n\nIt's unfortunate as I would love nothing more than to support small businesses in our local community, but this man doesn't deserve my business or any of yours.","stars":1}

I was \"helped\" by an older man (the same older man, I would assume that \"helped' the customer in a previous 2019 review), who scanned one of the items and then, when he discovered that there were two codes, asked me which item belonged to which code.  Having never returned two items at a time, each with a different code, I had no idea it was up to me to tell the UPS employee which one belonged to which item. I certainly understand that I was new to this and uninformed, but obviously *he* didn't.  He was SO rude and condescending!  He told me in *no* uncertain terms that *I* was the one to tell *him* which code belonged to which item.  I said that I would try to locate the information and stepped aside.  After a fruitless search for the info on my tiny phone screen, I told him that I would have to go home, get the code information and return.  As I was leaving, he said (in a very rude tone), \"WE don't work for Amazon\", and I said, \"Well, you work WITH them!\"  Otherwise, they wouldn't be using them as a drop-off location, right??  Since my experience sounds eerily like the one another poor customer had recently (see other reviews), I get the feeling that this guy doesn't really enjoy his work, or working with Amazon, or both. I certainly won't be returning to this location to find out.  I wish all of you a more pleasant experience.","stars":1}

So this isn't the usual 5 second drop off chore with a greeting & smile, but I didn't know it was going to turn into an hour of frustration- first because the older man insisted the code I had didn't work for no label drop off like I usually do.  So I quickly went back to my car and made a call to amazon to get a valid code.  \n  \nReturned to the store after amazon assured me a new right code was issued, the man said still didn't work.  So I exited the store again to my car and made another call to Amazon and this time I asked the lady to stay on the line in case the code doesn't work - she got to hear everything this rude man said to me, first he complained I was on the phone and went to the back room to finish his conversation after I only responded to the Amazon lady when she asked if I was at the store, not chatting with her.  \n\nThen he finally finished the call and came out to take care of several other people who came in after me without asking me if I needed help.  When I finally spoke up & asked if he could help me, he replied \"I'm helping my paying customers & I don't work for amazon.\"\n\nThat was unbelievable!

{"text":"The UPS STORE  by Kroger on Southport and Bluff.  I felt I  should identify the location because they are all over IndIndianapolis. This one in particular is very customer friendly. Whether your taking in Comcast equipment for return or sending something off of concern and want to make sure the partial is well cared this is the location to go to. Every time I've used this location & that's not that often there has always been somebody different take care of me. They are very thorough and make sure your every concern is met.","stars":5}

Offered a receipt, \"have a nice day\" and was out the door! \nNot open on Sundays but open late enough in the evening to get over there after work. Watch out for the craziness in the parking lot though, with the grocery store nearby there is a lot of traffic.","stars":4}
{"text":"Came here just before 6pm and the store was already locked. Knocked and showed the person inside that my phone (which is synced with global time) showed 5:59p, and that I only have one package to drop off, and he put his phone up probably just at the moment it turned 6:00pm and walked away. Either you guys need to pay your staff to go a few minutes over if a customer arrives shortly before closing like this, or this guy was just being a douchebag. This is Santa Barbara county, not Manhattan. Please address this.","stars":1}
{"text":"Went in for notary services. The clerk behind the desk was helping someone but quickly acknowledged me and asked what I was there for. He assured me a coworker would be out shortly. As promised, another young man came out and met me to notarize the documents. It was much quicker than when I've gone to the bank for the same service. It was less than twenty dollars and five minutes to get everything done. Would use their service again for sure!\n\nI also could not help but notice the excellent customer service the first clerk provided to his customer. A woman was there to send back a box with a return. She seemed new to online shopping and did not know about the return label or how to pull up her order info from an email. She struggled to figure out her phone but the clerk was patient and kind all the while. Together they figured out it would be easier for her to use the website, not app, to access her email. He set her up on a computer to get to it. He was helpful but gave her the space to both keep her info confidential and to avoid making her look completely inept.\n\nBoth employees were super friendly, professional, and attentive. Great job!","stars":5}

{"text":"Generally, I have had okay service, nothing great and nothing horrible.  However, I do expect that the core business of shipping packages would never be in question for timeliness and handling.  The store has been advertising to be the choice carrier for holiday returns, but they failed miserably on timeliness and I don't know yet about handling until the package is received.\nThere is no excuse for my package to have remained in this store from 12/28/2018 until 1/05/2019!  Did they not think I would be checking the package tracking???  Once it was dropped to the Philadelphia hub eight days later, the package has begun to move in expected timeline.  For my package to be sitting in this store for a week+ is irresponsible and BAD business.\nBest of luck trusting that your packages will be shipped timely!","stars":1}
{"text":"I've dealt with numerous UPS stores across the US, and this one is the best. Mainly, the agents are very friendly, efficient, timely, and professional - there is rarely a long line.

Highly recommend on all customer service fronts.","stars":5}
{"text":"Shipping is a mundane task, and if you're not printing your labels at home, it can take FOREVER at some of the stores around town. \n\nWell, I'm so glad I found my neighborhood UPS Store because dropping off packages here is a Five Star Experience every time. \n\nChloe and the other great staff members make each experience wonderful.\n\nIt starts with the friendly greeting. The stores small, so they see you coming from a mile away, but it's very nice to be acknowledged with a smile when you enter. \n\nThe entire team is intelligent, knowledgable, articulate and willing to answer just about any question you can throw at them. They're wonderfully efficient and quickly process each transaction, so you don't spend too long. \n\nBest of all, UPS offers a 5% discount for AAA Members too! It may not seem like much, but it can add up quick.\n\nThe store also sells packing and shipping supplies, offers P.O. Box service, and you can drop off for USPS too! \n\nI'll happily give my business to them any day of the week!","stars":5}
{"text":"I needed to ship a used computer to a company that offered me almost $500 to buy it. To ensure it would get there safely, I brought it to this UPS Store to have it packaged and shipped. Needless to say, the item was damaged in the process resulting in considerably less being given to me for the computer, not to mention the high price to package it (over $50, which did not include shipping)! After pursuing an insurance claim, UPS wrote back indicating that there were \"deficiencies in the packaging that was for this shipment.\" Now, the UPS Store gets paid for packaging, the computer is kept and reused by the company, and UPS gets paid for shipping. Who loses out? The little guy - me. Very disappointing all around.","stars":1}

{"text":"I used this facility to ship my son's Christmas package to him on 12/18/2018.  Apparently, regular customer protocol was not followed during the process--I was not told that the package would only be insured for $100 unless I purchased additional insurance and the package was NOT SHIPPED to the address that was printed neatly on the package.  As a result, my son received NO CHRISTMAS presents from home.  The package was never found!  I spent countless hours on the UPS website, with customer service on the phone, filing a claim, visiting the facility more than 4 times.  The atmosphere of the facility has been chaotic and non-helpful.  It has now been nearly two months and the reimbursement check that I was promised for $100 and my shipping cost (for my $357.37 value package) has STILL NOT BEEN RECEIVED.  Customer service at this facility is severely lacking and I will never initiate shipping a package with UPS ever again.","stars":1}
{"text":"You know those warranties that come with retail products, the ones that require you to find the original receipt, navigate a voice mail menu, follow complex troubleshooting instructions, and even pay for processing? Two recent cases have really tested my patience. At least the UPS Store makes the shipping part simple. The staff here is friendly, knowledgeable, and will patiently explain your options for packing and shipping.  Yesterday, I brought in a defective coffeemaker with its original box and an addressed envelope containing paperwork. They took care of the rest - no need for me to waste more time searching for bubble wrap, scissors, tape, or labels. Thanks, UPS Store, for making my complicated day just a little bit easier.","stars":4}

{"text":"The UPS store makes shipping packages easy.  Unlike the post office with all the forms you need to hand fill out each time you ship something, the UPS store takes your shipping info (sender and recipient) and enters it into their system for you.  If you ship to the same location again, they have the info already in the system, you don't need to have it re-entered.  Just provide your phone number to the associate and they will pull up the details and print out the shipping labels based on the service and options you select.  Easy in and out service without all the fuss of filling out multiple forms.  Mayra and the team at this location are super friendly and helpful.","stars":5}
{"text":"I try to only write positive reviews... But I just had a bizarre and upsetting experience here.  After waiting 20-25 minutes to drop off some Amazon returns, the clerk promptly started accusing me of \"being short with her.\"  I tried to apologize and say I hadn't meant to come off as short, but she cut me off before I could finish and started arguing with me, saying \"No, you are frustrated but that is no excuse for being rude and short with me. You were short with me and that is not appropriate.\" \n\nBy this point, I was frazzled from being verbally attacked by the clerk, and struggling to match up the Amazon codes with the items.  I tried to clarify that I was just trying to match up items, she kept arguing with me and growing impatient, \"can't you tell what matches.\" (Again, this is after waiting 20-25 minutes while a line snaked out the door and the employees did not care).  \n\nI tried to apologize again just to get through the awful experience, she cut me off again, saying in a REALLY SNARKY, RUDE VOICE \"Whatever, it's water under the bridge now.\" This was such a strange experience.  I will never go back there.","stars":1}

He wasn't wearing a mask and looked agitated (he was shouting at folks walking in about the line).  So when it was my turn, I asked him if he was okay, because he looked visibly upset.  Then, he threw his hands up in the air and yelled back, \"I don't need to help you, you know that right?\"  Indeed, he did not help me.  I reported the man and his behavior to the main UPS branch. Other customers looked scared and another couple of folks left after seeing this interaction.  SB/Goleta community: this guy is the embodiment of a jerk.  I know we are going through tough, opaque and strange time. On multiple fronts.  However, we have to maintain some kind of community/ kindness if we want to move forward through this.  Supporting businesses matter, but not ones that ruin your already heavy day.   \n\nI  was extremely disappointed and had to ship my research samples from a UPS in another county.  Didn't feel welcome, didn't feel safe, and was very disappointed by humanity that day.","stars":1}

My 4yo son was eyeing up the huge bubble wrap, and as I was explaining that we were not buying the bubble wrap- the nice gentleman gave him a piece and completely made his day (and mine!) The woman and man working were so kind and helpful, and made my hectic day so much better. Use this UPS store whenever you have to ship- they deserve your business!","stars":5}

It shows that two were scanned, but never left the store.  The other didn't have a receipt or tracking.  Terry B. took the bags and I could feel negativity, but I figured she was just overwhelmed before the holidays.  Not one of the sweaters made it back either via UPS or Post office.  I went back to the store to send back a fireplace.  I talked to Terry about it.  Rather than looking for the sweaters, she immediately got defensive.  She said \"amazon packages get lost all the time\".  Actually, no they don't.  I have never had this problem and now I have three with her at once.  At this point, I got nervous for my fireplace.  But, I left with the store owners name and number.\nTerri put the return label for the fireplace on the bottom of the box.  So, the 57 pound item was returned to me.  I had to send it again.\nI called Tom, the owner, because my alarm bells went off.  He was dismissive and rude.  I won't be back.  Tom owns two stores it seems.  The 7127 branch as well.\nTurns out, Staples took my fireplace back and they were nice to me.  What a debacle.  Save yourself the headache and send with reputable people.","stars":1}

We drove down and found him printing the second batch. Yeager, his Schnauzer, greeted us at the door. It was so very kind of Joe to stay later and in five minutes we had the fliers in hand. It's a dog-friendly place and Yeager seems to be the main attraction for people who come to check their mail boxes.

I usually pay .20 per copy today the employee charged me $2.10 for 1 copy.

Since UPS Stores offer all UPS services but have no power over delivery, they simply serve as an unnecessary proxy that will leave you with more questions than answers and eventually recommend you call the UPS 1-800 number.

I did find out if you are shipping smaller packages UPS is not the cheapest way to go, but if you are shipping larger boxes than UPS is the best choice.

Then, I got a call about a package I'd shipped \"a couple weeks ago,\" which was really a couple MONTHS ago, that hadn't been delivered because the person I'd sent it to hadn't picked it up \"at the access point.\" The access point, as far as I'm concerned, was the front door of the address I'd given them. The staff member I talked to could not explain why UPS hadn't left the package there, even though it was documented no signature had been required. Even though he was wearing a shirt that said \"UPS,\" he emphasized they were a totally separate company. So beware, this UPS store is not UPS, and this store has dreadful customer service.","stars":1}

I've been able to wrap up packages, print items, and take parcel measurements right in their front lobby. There are also a collection of PO boxes to one side of the store.\n\nI feel that the service here is always quick and friendly. The men behind the counter don't skip a beat and get me in-and-out in a matter of moments.

He directed everyone who only had drop off without requiring receipts to the left while he continued to serve the other clients.\n\nFortunately, mine was just a drop off and I did not need any receipt or immediate confirmation. For being the sole personnel though, he was trying to get things moving as quickly as he could and was friendly the entire time.  Perhaps this store would consider more staff?

{"text":"Won't use them again. They sent my package ( which was a baby gift) to the wrong address. Then a week later tried to get it back. They wanted my package back to prove to me that they were right and I was wrong. Like I don't know what my friend's address is.....basically they accused me of trying to scam them. I would have loved my package back, was a handmade crochet blanket. This was never resolved. Needless to say, I will NEVER use them to send anything of a personal nature again. Will use the U.S. Postal Service. If I must give a star to complete this review, I don't think that they even deserve one star.","stars":1}

{"text":"THE WORST place to print. they should LITERALLY take down any sign that reads \"Printing Services\".  I needed to print PDFs from an email on 11x17. The woman behind the counter swore they weren't PDFs because she didn't know how to open them and when I finally got a couple to download, she printed them at every size I DIDN'T need and insisted that she needed to select the printer and use the copier. She vehemently denied me the ability to use the copier stating that she had to use it. As if I'm completely ignorant on enlarging documents or using a copier at all. \nShe used a tape measure to try and get the right areas blown up, completely failing. I had no choice but to accept half legible documents and move on. When I would say \"yes that one is fine let's go to the next\" she would say \"no I need to make sure I got the whole area\". I'm pretty certain these are MY documents and if I say move on, then MOVE ON. \nI will NEVER got to UPS to print again.","stars":1}

{"text":"if i could give negative stars, i would! let me start off saying that i have used this location many times prior to send packages out and never encountered a problem until the past 2 weeks. \n\ni had 2 packages with pre-paid return labels to be sent out to 2 different places. The employee scanned them for me, printed out my receipt for the packages being dropped off. They were printed labels and told me he will tape them onto my 2 packages to be sent out. The employee made a mistake and switched the labels and they were sent to the wrong places.\n\n1 package was found and is currently being sent back to me, the other has not been found which costs over $100. The claim has finally been filed today after 2 managers and the owner have given me the round around. (had to contact both companies, and 2 different UPS reps multiple times because store would not)\n\nMy main issues are: the employee does not seem like he is owning up his mistake, 1 manager was away for the weekend and said he will call me back after speaking with him and never did. The other manager kept implying there is nothing they can do and did nothing to help resolve the issues. THE OWNER \"Ray\" (if thats his real name he gave me) called me with a restricted blocked number, told me it is MY FAULT that the packages were sent to the wrong locations because i did not place the labels on them myself (their employee is the one who offered to place the labels on for me). He does not want to take responsibility of his employee that made the mistake, nor did he try to help resolve the issues. He was very rude, loud, and disrespectful with his voice over the phone which is totally unacceptable and bad business. \n\nA rep from one of the companies that my package was supposed to be sent to was on the phone with me while the manager from this store was not trying to help resolve any issues. \n\nSmall business franchise for UPS needs guidance by some real UPS reps. Will never use this location ever again and hopefully my claims will get resolved and i wont be stuck paying out of pocket for THEIR negligence.","stars":1}

Both scenarios will be more fulfilling and less painful than trying to ship something here.\n\nTwice when I went in here I was told \"we don't make no ____ing money off of drop offs when you already have a label!\"  And that's my problem? Another time I arrived almost 25 minutes before close and they were locking the door.  I walked up to see if they were really closed as he was on his way out and was scolded \"No, no, no - absolutely no way.  We're closed!\"  What an interesting way to say hello!\n\nIf you're so fortunate as to make it inside this palace of failure, you'll find a team straight out of the 1980's workplace conduct training videos everyone enjoys so much.  You'll encounter everything they tell you to avoid from sexism and racism to pure incompetence, demeaning customers and even a dose of blaming management and corporate.\n\nI wish I could rope this place off and sell tickets.  It's a full on sideshow.\n\nBefore I'm met with the \"under new management since November\" answer, I had a run-in with them 3 weeks ago in November.  Try again.","stars":1}

He also offers excellent and creative printing services at very good rates too. This is not no ordinary UPS store!","stars":5}

{"text":"To be fair, this is a review based on a small business not being a little flexible for a customer. I arrived at the location at 4:05, after the usual South Street/4th Street parking issues. I walked up to the door showing my pick up notice and knocked. there were two or three people apparently in the office talking to one another, one of which turned showed me for fingers to indicate the store had closed five minutes before, and went back to his conversation. I resisted the urge to reply with a single finger, and decided instead to post this review. I have used the store before,and I've been satisfied with what they do. I've also found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. Whoever was working today was boorish and, frankly, pretty stupid. Small businesses distinguish themselves from their competitors by being flexible with their customers. In the future, I will be using a UPS pick up/drop off center in the food store at the corner of Catherine and 4th. Their hours are considerably better, and the staff is always pleasant and helpful. No four fingers there.","stars":1}
{"text":"Instead of pulling up in front of the store and feeding the meter, park for free in the center lot of the Pilgrim Gardens Shopping Center. Sometimes there are lines and a wait, yet sometimes you can walk in and out with no problems. I've experienced both situations but don't go here frequently enough to know if there are any patterns to customer traffic. If you need to ship packages and haven't bought packaging materials yet, the store does have some for purchase. The customer in front of me was shipping a baseball bat, and the employee produced a cardboard tube that worked nicely. As for me, I had already gone to Target and bought my packaging materials there. Not sure how much the difference is price-wise, but it might be worth looking into if you're trying to be economical. My guess is that Target is cheaper. As with shipping any big packages, prices aren't cheap, so make sure to bring enough cash or use a credit card. My 18 x 18 x 16 package was about $20.","stars":3}
{"text":"The guy was rude, tossed my brand new printer into the shipping box with no care at all. He wrote the wrong shipping address to MY COLLEGE which i think i know the correct address, and when i corrected him he had said \"they know where they are going its fine\". He also had charged me 10$ for a cardboard box because \"his rent was high\" which i couldve gotten for 2$ at any other place. He charged my credit card a way higher amount than what was on my receipt. DO NOT GO HERE! IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE! I had to email corporate to make sure my shipping address was correct. I wish I could give no stars!!","stars":1}
{"text":"What a great ups store. He did some work for me printing new business cards. I also decided to rent a box from him. It's nice to add a street address for my business instead of just a PO Box. It makes my clients feel better. He is incredibly friendly. I think his name is Reggie. He apparently bought the store not too long ago and he's really cleaned it up. Stop by and check it out if you need any business services.","stars":5}
{"text":"This place is top notch. \nI have used other UPS stores owned by different owners and the experience was a \ncomplete disaster.

{"text":"This store is complete sh*t and I will never return to it to send a package. The manager is completely retarded and tries to nickel and dime you for everything. UPS stores are suppose to carry FREE express saver bags to ship items but this store elects to not carry them so that they can charge people to buy a box or different envelope. The UPS up the road on Bloomingdale is far more friendly and they carry the bags one needs to ship items without charging them. DO NOT VISIT THIS STORE UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TO GIVE IT TO YOU DRY.","stars":1}
{"text":"I don't know where the terrible reviews are coming from but I love them here! Printing, sending, copying, anything - they do it and they do it so promptly and with a smile on their face. They support all of their customers and really get to know you if you're a returning customer. Even though they have a small and kind-of-messy-looking store they do everything professionally. I'm from south Philly and come all the way to South street to get stuff sent out or printed from here just because of the great experience I have, and how reliable they are. This UPS store and their employees rock, plain and simple. Five stars and no less!","stars":5}

{"text":"Nope, no way. I strongly recommend making the trip to havertown. Had two occasions to stop in there, once to ship something another time to fax something. Most recently, while waiting in line the employee asked \"why aren't you women at home cooking?\" It was 5pm and the other four customers were also women. I should have walked out then but instead I waited my turn and while the employee was helping me I asked \"hey dinner comment, kind of offensive, huh?\" He didn't respond but just grumbled and told me the charge for services. I called the 800 number on the ups site and the customer service rep apologized and sent an email to the owner directly. It's been 2 weeks so it's fair to say I won't be getting a response from the owner. I know local businesses rely on reviews so I tried to give the owner a fair shot to redeem himself but looks like he doesn't care.","stars":1}
{"text":"I first recall visiting the UPS Store when it was still on South, before its relocation to 4th Street.   I had stopped in to have some flyers copied for a show I was in, and much to my delight, Scott (the friendly and helpful associate) gave my show a shout-out on Facebook! I have also stopped in many times to print and fax various documents and also to drop off my cable box and modem after cancelling my Comcast service.  The best part is if you are sending equipment back to Comcast, the UPS Store will ship it to them for you at no charge (and no hassle)! So if you go into this location, ask for Scott, but if he's not there, you'll be in great hands with any associate.","stars":5}

Each time the guys who work there were professional, speedy, friendly, and actually seemed to care.  They had some really great nice words (and claims that they were passing along good karma!) when I went in frazzled and frustrated to do employment stuff. \n\nTake away: solid services, sweet guys, allow small dogs (I saw a cute one in there).","stars":5}

In and out in under 10 minutes.  I'd say when i walked in, there were 3 other customers.  They also have a notary public which I needed at the time to verify my signature.

Hope my shipment makes it safely to my mother back up north in Miami.","stars":3}
{"text":"Stopped by to ship an item. The staffs here were pretty friendly. I had 3 staff members greeted me within 2-3 minutes of walking into the store. Someone checked on me to see if they could help me with anything so there was no wait time. Even though there was only one person in front of me at the time. Everything service wise was pretty straight forward.  Filled out a shipping slip, had them packaged the item I was planning to ship. Checked with me if I needed my item insured or tracked. The staffs overall were very friendly and professional. I wasn't very picky about the price since its UPS (you get what you paid for). I would have no other company (USPS or FedEx) handling my fragile valuables unless UPS wasn't an option. I wouldn't mind coming back next time. Now the only thing that would change my rating on this place would be if my item wasn't packaged properly. (RMA items could get sketchy when shipped and if damaged along the way, voids product warranty claims) \n\nUPDATE: I know I'm late with the update. The package arrived on time without a problem. Great service and much thanks. 5 stars it remains.","stars":5}

I needed to only print out a shipping label and was going to have to wait for someone printing wedding invitations and/or other things in various batches. After I heard she thought she could get a discount for printing so much, I asked to jump in when she paused between jobs. The UPS gentleman did his best to cue up the print from my USB and do what looked like a pause on her prints in order that my one page could come out of the only printer hooked up for the purpose. \n\nIt would have been fantastic if they had a \"manager's only\" computer/printer that could have printed out the label for my drop off package.

It all adds up to, instead of them paying me, she is holding my claim based on when she gets paid from her subcontactor.  The problem is, my contract was not with their subcontractor, my contract was with their store, and by consumer law should have been processed and funded by now.  It is illegal to hold claims based on subcontractor relationships.

Horrible horrible horrible. \n\nUPDATE:  The Manager's response below is simply not true. I was a customer for 4 years. My company is growing and we moved to an office.

Should I have come in with everything fully taped and ready to go? Yes.. but it also shouldn't have been an issue if I needed a little at the edge, as it isn't an issue at every other UPS store I've ever gone in.

{"text":"really annoyed with this place. first of all, on the UPS website it says they are open until 5:30pm on Saturdays. Just to make sure, I called first and they said they close at 5. ook. So I get to the front door at exactly 4:53 and they're already locked up, lights out. What a sham. If you say you're going to be open until 5, please be open until then. I've worked in retail and I lock the doors when I'm supposed to. They must have closed at least a few minutes before 4:53 too, because it was dark in there and nobody was to be found. Not cool.","stars":1}

When I planned a surprise birthday party for my wife, Reggie and his team really came through and turned around a high-quality vinyl banner in less than 24 hours.

{"text":"I have been a faithful customer at this location for over 6 years. I joined when Larry owned this store on Northdale. He was spectacular and ALL ABOUT his customers. Afterall, this is a premium mail service. I pay approx $75 every 3 months. When I received perishable items (foods/flowers) Larry always called me right away. I was sad to see him leave. I stayed on with the new owners. This past month (April/May/June) I had 2 major deaths in my family (including the death of Mom). On May 30th, 2017 flowers were delivered to this UPS store for me.\nStaff members, Gabriel a part-timer, and even the owner (manager) failed to call me. According to Gabriel, both the owner and a lead staff member were the ones who received the flowers on May 30th. However they were soo busy that they did not call me. Additionally, they failed to enter my name into their mailing system in order for me to receive emails regarding delivery of packages. On June 1 (Thursday), I actually drove to the location to get mail and other packages. The flowers were there, but Gabriel forgot to give them to me. \nThe next day (Friday June 1), I called this store to see if I had any mail. Gabriel confessed that he made a mistake and was soo busy with paper work and buried in the computer that he forgot to give me the flowers the day before. So my flowers had wilted and were just about dead and some of the water evaporated. So my flowers for my deceased loved ones sat in the store for 4 days and died. I was upset. I asked for some type of courtesy credit on my 3 month subscription that I had just renewed a couple of week earlier. The owner refused to compensate me in any way. Delivery of flowers is a premium service. The whole goal is to make sure flowers are delivered promptly because they require attention. It was very painful to get dead flowers for dead loved ones. I left the flowers at the UPS store. I could not bear to bring them home with me. Flowers represent life, love, living things and more. UPS really hurt me by their insensitive actions. This is a franchise. They have the ability to issue some type of credit if they want. It's inappropriate to tell me how busy they were. This is not my concern. If it were for customers, then they would not be SOOOO BUSY. They lost sight of what was most important - THE CUSTOMER. I will call my credit card company to see if I can get a partial credit on the 3 month subscription. They are not willing to refund my 3 month subscription fee. So, I will not renew at this location. I will post this review on Google as well.","stars":1}

A $20.00 hold was put on my card and the young lady said she can't do anything to fix issue that she will give me free copies next time.

The associate who originally assisted me missed a step and I was on a business call while in the store. Shortly after leaving I realized, I wasn't sure if he notarized  the letter as I requested. When I called back he took a defensive turn to state that I didn't remind him because I was in the phone and I pointed out I was specific in the initial instructions. The package was on its way in the truck and he would reach out to have it returned to the store. When I called back he was professional and focused on the solution which I appreciate. The store owner was available when I returned to the store. He was aware of the situation and took care of verifying my ID as well as getting the document notarized.  \nI completely appreciate the way this was all handled because it never became about who's fault it was!

{"text":"I just happened to be in this Ups store neighborhood @ 10:55am on  12/12/15.    I needed to get fingerprints for my work that are required. I have never gotten fingerprints before.   I looked @ their website regarding getting fingerprints and it stated that appointments are PREFERRED. So I thought I would just see if I could get them @ this store.    Well they should tell their employees that because when I walked in just to inquire  I was greeted by the most rude & obnoxious employee.  When I asked about it he stated \"So I guess you don't have an appointment!\" in a sarcastic tone. He stated that he had someone scheduled for an appointment soon but they had not arrived yet.  He might do them if the appointment does not come in the next minute.  He said it  takes 30 minutes to get fingerprints.   He was really annoyed by the fact that I didn't have one.  So then I stated to him \"well your website states that it is preferred not required, should I not get them now. \"  He said well they have really been trying to get that website changed so that it says required, but they have been unable to do so.  OMG I was the only customer in the store @ the time. He never apologized or anything.   A customer had just walked out of the store.  So then when another employee was finished with the only other customer, he told him to do my fingerprints and that he does them all week and doesn't want to do them on weekends.  WELL why is he even working at this store.  My fingerprints did not take 30 minutes either, only took about 5 minutes. I had gone to UPS stores to ship packages etc,  well I will not be going to any UPS store if this is how they treat their customers.","stars":1}

{"text":"So, I'm conflicted in my review, and I'll explain why. I needed prints made of some of my paintings. I've never done this before, and I don't have much money (and that's and understatement....), so I was concerned about cost. If I had them printed i black and white, it was going to be cheaper than in color, but seeing as how the paintings themselves were in black and grays, I figured it would be fine. Scot tried to explain to me that Black is a color, but the cost differential would be almost a $50 versus $35 difference, and that means 3 days worth of food for me. I heard what he told me, but it was the way he said it to me and the way he had spoken to me throughout our entire correspondence that really went up my rear. He offered to do one just to show me the difference, but I was so put off by his tone and I felt so uncomfortable that I didn't wast to waste one extra second in the store. I wanted to get out of there as soon as humanly possible. When we pulled up the photos from my camera card, I hadn't labeled the pictures or marked which ones I wanted printed, and he sighed and almost reprimanded me, saying \"see? how am i supposed to know which ones you want printed ?\" I was embarrassed and said \"i'm sorry - i forgot - I'll mark them\" and he went off to deal with other orders while i did that. I understand they were busy and he had a lot to do other than help hold my hand through my order, but still, if you can't help me the way i need to be helped, then send me somewhere else. The condescending tone he used was so humiliating, so offputting, that what began as something great that I wanted to do for myself turned into me feeling like I was clueless and awful for not investing the money to get the color printing....i, in fact, WAS clueless - i SAID i had never done this before, and if I was met with a more open and easygoing attitude, I may have either waited until i had more money to do it right, or just gotten a very tiny number of them done to test. but the goal was to have them in time to go sell at first friday, and he said they MIGHT be ready by then, he'll call me. I waited and waited...they closed at 7.....i get a phone call at 7:10, I had given up on getting to first friday - it was way too late to sell - and he calls and leaves me a voicemail. I saw the call come in. i was at starbucks having a coffee 2 blocks away, feeling dejected and defeated after accepting my plans were shot. I purposely didn't answer - i was pissed. I waited 3 days to go pick up my prints, which looked AWFUL. I know it was my choice to not print in color, but these couldn't be sold. Scott had initially taken a 1/2 deposit from me, but he waived the rest and let me have the prints, which I appreciated and it was a good painkiller for a painful lesson. \n             So, conflicted because there is no burden of fault here - it was a conflict of personalities that spiraled into a negative experience. I'm sure they do good work - but I wish I didn't get anxiety from being spoken to like a child.","stars":2}

The other two employees went to the back when a line started forming. When it was my turn, I told them I needed to get something notarized. I was told that she is not working today.

{"text":"Kristi,\n\nYou took the time to reply, which means you do care about your reputation and business, which I give you the credit for that. I am a scientist with a PhD degree, so I just want to write the rebuttal based on facts, and I believe people who read through this story will have their own judgement. \n\n1) It was your staff who gave me the wrong information (I do not blame her, she is very nice to me over the phone) and directed me to your store for this service which you do not provide. In response of your statement that I threat you to get the notarization against the law, here is the FACT CHECK. In my previous post on Google review, I wrote \"I understand this is what it is and was not trying to argue with that.\" So I don't need you to educate me that NO one can challenge the law. If it cannot be done, it simply cannot be done. I may not have the highest moral standard, but as I said I have a PhD degree and I am professional, I believe I have the respect of law and people. Why do you have to lie about that I threat you to get the notarization? Seriously? How did I threat you? What did I say? If you have the video or audio record, PLEASE release it so the public knows what is going on. I reserve my right to fight you in the court in this false allegation. I simply asked for an explanation about the miscommunication. You are the one who raised the voice and started the argument, that's what I have to say. \n\n2) You write \"Upon your arrival, I did apologize\". NO, that's another lie. You NEVER apologize, otherwise it will not end as it was. You apparently feel very proud of yourself being the BIG boss of a UPS store, however you did not take the responsibility of being a leader. Your employee gave me the wrong information, and you should apologize on her behalf.  \n\n3) You are right that FedEx does not offer notarization service. I went to FedEx to ship a package, not to get a notarization.  Remember I asked you \"can I ask another question? \" before you ordered me to leave?  The question I intended to ask is whether you know if other places can offer such notarization service and whether I can ship a package using UPS. Remember what you said? You said \"you can ask, but I already gave you the answer, we cannot do it\". How arrogant is that? You don't even know what I am trying to ask. If you don't know how to be professional, let me teach you. This is what you should say \"I am sorry for the mis-communication and we wasted your time, what else can we do for you, sir?\" Think twice before you treat a future customer like you did for me. \n\n4) You are apparently very mice to another customer, who is a Caucasian, before you turned 180 degree when you interacted with me, which is an Asian. I had a very pleasant experience with two other employees in your UPS store, the young lady who answered my phone the day before and the older lady who greeted me when I stepped in your store. I tend not to link this with your racial preference, but you know what this actually is. Note that another Google reviewer posted very negative experience with the store OWNER specifically. Whether that refers to you or not you know it better than anybody else. \n\nI pledge you to be professional and be a person with integrity. It is not difficult to admit the wrong doings by simply say SORRY. Finally, treat people with respect regardless of their race and color and BE NICE. \n\nBest","stars":1}

{"text":"The store owner, Kristi Caton, is just a horrible person. She yelled at the customer and asked the customer to leave!!!\n\nThe public deserves to know what kind of person Kristi Caton is before they make a decision whether to use their service or not. The arrogant behavior of Kristi turns out not to be a coincidence. Browsing through Google and Yelp reviews did identify another customer who had an unpleasant encounter with Kristi. This store generally receives good review, which I believe largely due to her employees. A compliant is going to be sent to UPS and the company should be altered that someone is jeopardizing its reputation. \n\nHere is what happened. I need to get a notarization for a birth certificate. I called yesterday (05/07/2019) and a lovely lady (not the owner!) answered that phone and told me that they can do that. I showed up today and told them I need a notary service. A senior lady greeted me and tried to help me with that.  During the process, Kristi stepped in and said they cannot offer this service because it is an official document. I explained to her that I got a confirmation from them yesterday and that's why I am here. She suddenly became irritated and very arrogant. She said whoever answered the phone didn't know and she has the final say. Before I tried to ask her whether she knows other places I can get such notarization, she said \"you probably should leave\". Is that how a customer should be treated? Not only did she not offer an apology for the mis-communication, she also apparently blamed me for this chaos. \nLuckily, I got my job done in a nearby FedEx store.","stars":1}

Attempted to drop off an EMPTY 12 bottle shipper to send to FL and they tried to charge me $91 for a 5 lb. box. Did I mention it was empty. When I questioned this insane price, he played around with the dimensions to get it down to the super low price of $48! Wow. How nice of him.\nBe warned, you have to ASK them what it is the least expensive option. They are salespersons and only tell you how much it will cost to get it there on a specific day, so they are not quoting you for ground shipping. Sneaky peeps abound.

{"text":"On Dec. 22, 2012 My mom went to mail a speaker system of 2 speakers and a little box to me in San Diego. She was very sick and didnt realize how sick she was till she went to the hospital that next week. She wasn't thinking that good cause of the illness. She trusted the store employee who is Eric. She paid for the shipping and the store packing of the speaker system and the little box. \n\nThe bill she was giving was very high from what was quoted on the website she called me when getting home. I said ok let's wait till the packages to arrive, to check it at another ups store. He received the packages and then saw that the one speaker that is 38 inches long was wrapped tightly with bubble wrap and put in a box 45 inches long. NO other packing inside, so it could move back and forth freely. He took the boxes to the local ups store and asked how much to send these as shown on the boxes. \n\nThere was a huge difference in prices, which ranged from $43 to $73. The higher amount as if the box was shipped at 39 inches as it should of been. She got billed for the bigger box used with the air gap and charged 4 pounds heavier for each box. SO she was Charged for 8 pounds extra and 6 inches of air space. \n\nThe owner, Mark Mercure said it was packed by trained professionals and packed and shipped by UPS standards. He also claimed the San Diego store didn't know what they were doing. If this is the \"new\" UPS standards we hate what happened to UPS shipping. She have been trying for over a month to get any of my refund for the correct shipping size and weight. But the owner and UPS store corporate are not going to refund me.\n\nWatch your money at this shady-money taking business owned by Mark, fyi he also owes the Doylestown location.","stars":1}

A debate ensued between employees about whether this was accurate or not.\n\nClearly it is not because today when I went to pick up the associate told me how many packages of wine people picked up today! \n\nThey also ALWAYS ask what's in the box? None-of-your-business is how I feel but I always answer. Are you even allowed to ask that?????????? \n\nAnyway... I got a call earlier this week that they had two packages of mine and if I didn't come get them this week they'd be sent back. I called said no problem, I'll be there Friday to pick up.\n\nSo here we are Friday. Guess what, they shipped one package back and kept the other. Asinine. To top it off I've paid $10 every time I've gone per box. Today I was informed... we have new ownership and the owner decided this box will cost $20 and the box they shipped back after telling me they wouldn't, would cost me $40. So why and what happened to cause the up charge? \"Because the owner wanted to.\" Was the response. Well new ownership has been around for six months right? \"Well no since November.\" Yeah that's six months cause ya know it's April. And I've been here twice since November so not that new and this has not happened before. \n\n\nSo here's the deal... I'm done with your shop. Poor customer service, poor communication, and I refuse to support ANY business that price gauges. \"Because the owner decided.\" Keep an eye out for a direct email from me that'll be quite a bit more colorful. I'll be sure to include the folks/department that gave you the license for the franchise as well. \n\nZero stars if I could - disgruntled former customer.","stars":1}

When the package finally got to Philadelphia UPS store that a friend of mine owns we found the box size was changed along with tracking numbers(the charge was for 13 pounds box actually weighted was 7). Turns out that I was grossly over charged 38.00 dollars. I wound not have even know that If I didn't have someone in the Philadelphia. Ok that's not it. When I returned to the store in Springhill I  waited almost 20 more minutes to talk someone in charger (tall blonde with big attitude) Ms. Caroline had a customer but she also had other workers that wasn't doing anything at the time.

Most pack-and-ships don't care so much. \n\nI would trust Reggie with a vintage piece of glass. I would trust him with anything that is fragile and valuable - he is that good. He is also kind and easy to work with.  No ego issues.\n\nReggie's knowledge and care do not come with an exorbitant price tag. I was very surprised at how reasonable all his time and materials cost.

{"text":"I will start out by saying that I created a yelp profile just to write a review on how terrible this store is.  I have never been to a UPS store where they have tried to nickel and dime you so bad. I went in with my package and my packing slip and was told it would be an additional $2.13 to seal the box. Then when I asked how much it would be for an entire roll of tape they said $2.12. I have never been charged at a UPS store for them to put one piece of tape (about 6 inches long) over the opening on a box.  The worst part is they didn't even mention the fact that the tape was less money then it would be for them to pack it until I asked. Then when I decided I would buy the entire roll of tape instead of having them pack it for me they gave me the nastiest attitude about it.  To top off my entire experience I only had my debit card on me and I couldn't even pay for the tape with my card because there was a five dollar minimum to use a card. I had to walk in the pouring rain to Publix to use the ATM to walk all the way back to pay them the $2.12. Moral of the story is go to any other place in this store to mail your package, use a pigeon, use a pony, use anything else then the store.","stars":1}

If you are looking for friendly, reliable and knowledgeable service its best to keep looking.  I've been in Indy since Feb 09 and they have had a \"Now Hiring\" sign on the door this entire time.

He told me \"Why would I want to lose my job by taking my credit card info\" and \"I could just open it when you leave.\" While he was correct, his attitude and customer service was horrible! I emailed the store and here was the response I received:\n       \" Well often times an associate is in the middle of things and its common practice to set a package aside to pack later. If he was performing a task that require him to continue after assisting you he was performing his duties as required. He stated he was just joking with you and that he did not mean to insult you. The associate in question is a long time employee and has been with us for many years.

The store was pretty clean and there was a short line of customers with one female employee working. So when I came in to drop off the package, I simply said that I was dropping this off and she responded with \"Ok, do you need a receipt?\", to which I replied \"No thanks\" because I had confidence that this package was in good hands as the return label was already adhered and ready to go. \n\nBy the next day, I was able to track down the package to ensure it did leave the building as I had hoped.

Patience - this store has some more elderly people as customers, well older then me and I am 57.  Elderly can be difficult to work with at times because of physical challenges and speed of execution. I have seen this team, time and time again, deal with difficult issues with Patience, Kindness and a Smile.  All without rolling their eyes or acting perturbed.   \n\n2. Attentiveness - This stores team is actively listening when spoken to and if unsure will repeat back the details to make sure their shipment is taken care of correctly.  \n\n 3. Acting Skills - This goes back to Patience.  Sometimes people are just p*ssed off angry!  Sometimes for a reason and some not.  I have seen an interaction between Kristi and a customer where she was able to calm the customer down by slowing her speech and talking in a softer volume.  She has a gift for talking people down from the edge.  \n\n4.  A Calming Presence -  This ties to #3 and is directly why I come to this store.  During their most busy times there is a calm exhibited.  I believe that comes from their confidence in what they do and that they have an ongoing relationship with their clients.  I noticed that the very first time I went in.   \n\n5.   Empathy - I've seen them show empathy and they have for a situation I was dealing with as well.  \n\nI go out of the way to use this store.

When we brought this to the attention of Chris, the manager, he said we should have put this in writing.  Since when is a simple verbal instruction insufficient?\n\nThe employees treated us as if we were a major burden to them.  There was no attempt  to rectify the situation in any way.

The employees regularly nickel and dime you for piece of tape always lack customer service. The female employee regularly has a snarky or sarcastic remark when you want to take your own box.  Today I went to send three packages I had packaged them with labels and sleeves I simply had to tape them up the UPS driver who was in store decided to tell me the packages should be going fed ex and the associate chimed in to tell me that it would take far too long to package them scan them before the UPS driver could make them a part of his pick up for today. Literally wouldn't have taken more than 5 minutes I just needed tape.

Few days back, I was there to drop a package and asked to check whether I correctly input the declared value in the shipment label I created from the internet. Staff said yes and gave me a receipt.

The clerk called the owner - and he asked if I knew him - when I said I didn't, he refused to honor the price I was quoted.  When I asked for a price list the clerk said they don't have the prices written down anywhere - hmmmn.  And - my collated copies were not collated - \"the machine did it wrong\" . Uhhhh . Really? The machine? The owner of the store would not redo them so this poor high school girl collated  them all by hand and was late to her next job.

{"text":"These guys are shady. I would give zero stars if I could.\n\nOn Mon Dec 10, 2018 I shipped a package from UPS store #5082 in Royersford, PA to another UPS store in Shoreline, WA (20126 Ballinger Way NE).  I asked the shipper if I could ship from one UPS store to another and they told me that was fine but it would cost extra.  I agreed and paid $157.38 for this shipment.  Upon arrival, the WA UPS store rejected the package and had it shipped back. Once I saw the package had been signed for, I called this UPS store and was told it was shipped to the post office as a man named \"Darren\" had signed for it (which I could see via tracking) and they said no Darren worked at this UPS store.  I told them this was ridiculous as it had my return address and was shipped from their store.  After minutes of arguing they admitted it was in their store.  I was stunned and headed out to get my package from them.\n\nI went to this store to retrieve my package and get a refund but was shocked when the UPS store said I could not have my money back and that I had to pay the return shipping to get my package back (an additional $97.63).  They said I had to pay the money then file a claim with the parent UPS corporation.  I paid the money, collected my package and called the UPS office.  I was then told they cannot file my claim and that I have to resolve it myself with the PA UPS store.  After much back and forth with the parent corporation and this branch, I eventually found out I had to call a second UPS corporation and filed a complaint.  It has been 18 days with no further follow up even after two requests for an update.\n\nI went to fedex and shipped the same package for only $110.  A customer there told me this UPS store overcharges among other shady things (obviously this is second hand but I'm inclined to believe it).  So BEWARE.  Shady dealings, overcharging and terrible customer service.\n\nI'm still out of my $255 and have not heard back from UPS corporate after two emails asking for an update.","stars":1}

Jerry was not helpful at all and I had to call and email him several times to get any information from him since he would never come through with his follow-up claims. Even though I paid extra to increase the insurance for it, UPS did not compensate me in any way. Honestly, the whole experience ruined UPS as a whole for me.","stars":1}

{"text":"My family shipped some antiques from this store to me in Colorado.  All of the items were insured.  We paid a good amount of money for the insurance.  The UPS store did a great job of packing all items.  When the boxes arrived they were delivered by a freight shipping company.  There were about 8-10 boxes or multiple sizes.  I asked the driver if he would stay as I needed to unwrap each box to make sure things arrived without damage.  he said he could and would not stay and to report any damages to the UPS store if I found any problems.  Unfortunately a very valuable brass lamp was damaged.  I reported this to the manager of he UPS store immediate.  Andrew, the manager was very helpful.  However the insurance company used by the shipper is horrible.  It's been more than 4 months since the problem occurred.  Photo's of the damaged boxes and lamp were provided.  Andrew has called the insurance company repeatedly with very little response.  The final repair bill for the lamp was over $200 and the insurance company told Andrew that they had finally approved the claim after he called, texted and emailed them multiple times.  To date I have still not been paid.  If you use UPS at this location make sure you find out about their insurance company and get a guarantee that they will pay you for any verified damages.  Again, Andrew has been terrific however UPS contracted with this freight company to handle the deliver and this insurance company and they have been pathetic and not worth shipping with them because they can't get the insurance company to make a payment of the claim which was supposedly approved by this same company.","stars":1}

I'd understand if we traded words or if I'd come in angry and cruel, but from the minute I walked in he was as sour as a lime.\n\nWon't be coming back as I wish to avoid talking to him; I'm sure they are full service and capable but he is too unpleasant to bear.

Amazing. \n\nYou'll see in the other reviews here that almost everyone remembered his name, Paul, which I think is testimony as to his commitment to a positive customer experience. \n\nHe has a few long time employees there that do well too. \n\nSuper easy to drop off Amazon packages or mail stuff.

I had a Canadian address, complete with a zip code that I eventually figured out was 100% correct.

You'd kinda have to be there to understand, but just believe me when I say this wasn't a matter of incompetence. He was doing the thing where you're as passive-aggressive as you possibly can be to a customer without being overtly unprofessional, and it distracted him to the point that he forgot how to work the computer system.\n\nJust do your freaking job, dude.

The most ridiculous scam at this place is that you have to pay to confirm that a fax went through. Let me explain that this would be like getting your car repaired and then paying a separate fee to confirm that it's been repaired. Imagine paying for your car repair, and then paying for a separate print out to confirm that it's been repaired? That's what a receipt is for. If you're paying for the fax then confirmation should be part of your receipt. This is absolute outrageous.

To print, the minimum amount of minutes you get charged for is five and that costs $2.50. Be careful when you are printing because their default is color printing which costs more. I asked the sales representative a couple of questions regarding charges which he did not answer fully when I realized I had been charged for items that he had told me I would not be charged for. Even if I'm desperate to print something short notice in the future I doubt I'll return here.","stars":1}

I call 1-800-terrible-serviceUPS and receive no explanation as to why no one was there to deliver after 5pm as the slip indicated.

It's on a truck being delivered to my home that no one is there to sign for!!!

What added insult to injury was the fact that I, was totally taken in by the affability of the owner and her husband..  He was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely reassuring that the perishable items I was shipping overnight  across the country would be packaged and handled with care by him personably. \nWithout getting into all of the details, suffice it to say that EVERYTHING this man said was a lie.

My wife and I both went and we were in and out in less than 10 minutes.

I called and asked that it be delivered to my house the next and received confirmation that it would be. One week later and many empty promises later, it finally arrived. And this was after me calling EVERY day to see why my package was not delivered. One person even told me that she \"would personally be responsible for placing my package on the truck.\" Despite her promise, it did not happen. Yesterday they promised that my package was going to be delivered at 10:30 a.m. It got delivered at 5:30 p.m. I really needed this package to send to an upholsterer in California for a project last week, and now I have to express mail it. Because they delivered it so late, I have to wait until tomorrow to ship it out. All the UPS people agree I have been treated like shit, but they refuse to offer me anything except an apology.

Everyone has been SUPER helpful on very occasion, including providing me with helpful extra information and small courtesies free of charge.

I went here to get finger printed for a job and the first time I attempted to get finger printed, I was told by a UPS employee that I would need to come back because I did not have my registration ID. Also, when telling me this, the employee wasn't being attentive to our conversation as he turned his back to me mid-conversation and walked away from me while talking. From this, I definitely believe the staff here is rude and unhelpful. Anyways, when I applied online beforehand (a requirement for fingerprinting here) I was told I wouldn't need the ID.. so here we have conflicting statements. So my first attempt was unsuccessful, I left the store and returned the next day with my registration ID. As I was speaking to the woman who would be finger printing me, it was revealed that I actually didn't need my ID and could've been scanned yesterday! (You just need your SSN!) So thanks to an uninformed employee (or lazy because he didn't want to finger print me) I had to take an extra 30+min out of my day to go back to this store. Not a fan of this UPS stores employees, and I will go elsewhere next time.","stars":2}

Instead we had to email it...which took about 20 minutes for her to scan 9 pages then I had to walk her step by step on how to attach a document and email it. And the she charged me 1 dollar...per page! 9 dollars and an hour of my life to send one fax. A line is of course forming as she is the only worker in the store. Unpleasant and more than an irritating experience. This is not a ups store, this place is a disaster.

My response was, \"Oh, I don't think they charged me to use the computer last time...is this a new rule?\" At least no one ever informed me it was two dollars...His response, \"Well I've worked here for 3 years and it's always been 2 dollars.\" Talk about a snarky and rude attitude.

However, when checking tracking it stated that I would arrive the day after when I would already be on my flight. I called to explain that I was promised a Tuesday delivery, and they offered no recompose, saying that the staff must have read the screen wrong. They said that I signed a packing slip which had a Wed date on it. I no longer have the slip so I have no idea if it is actually true or not.

What's worse, is when my contract was up with them, their \"manager\" Cory told me he would not set up a mail forward, and sarcastically gloated about how he was going to throw my mail into the trash.  \nHe said to set up a mail forward with the Post Office.  He said that even if I did that, any mail that accidentally got delivered would be thrown in the trash. When I cited the federal law that requires them (as a commercial mail receiving agency) to set up a mail forward for 6 months, he tried to change his story that he never said I couldn't set up a mail forward with his office.

I walked over to the computer and just as I was logging on I was greeted with a snarky remark from the employee working there....\"I hope you know it's 2 dollars to use the computer! \" I responded with, \"Oh, I don't think I was ever charged that before. Is this a new policy?\" Maybe I had been charged that before but no one actually ever told me that. To which the employee responds, \"Um, I've worked here for 3 years and that's always been the policy.\"  I honestly wasn't upset that I has to pay the 2 dollars because I had to print in color and this was the closest place to my work. Because he was so rude and unprofessional I'll happily take my money elsewhere.","stars":1}

{"text":"After trying repeatedly to bring my business to this shamefully lax and inattentive UPS store, I have given up.  Note that, like many UPS locations, this store is privately owned (as a franchise, I believe).  That helps me understand why there seems to be no accountability at this location, despite the fact that it sports the huge UPS logo.  Repeatedly the guys behind the counter carry out the tasks *I pay them to perform* while engaged in personal calls on their cells.  The other reviewer who said the staff are not enthusiastic about their jobs was making an understatement.  It's as if you accosted them in their bathroom. The last straw was when I called to check something very simple, the charge for sending a package from their location (the store adds on charges in addition to what UPS charges), and the person who answered the phone didn't even know about the most basic aspects of UPS billing, like adding the requirement that a package be signed for in front of the UPS deliverer.  In the current economic climate, nobody needs to spend more money for less (or no!) service.  Sheesh.","stars":1}

{"text":"This is the closest UPS store to my home, but I prefer the one on Gunn & Van Dyke in Odessa or the one on Linebaugh & Countryway. Here's why:\n\nMy first time dropping off packages here I asked for a dolly. The owner was reluctant to let me use it, then told me that some other person put too much on it and flattened the tire, so I need to be careful with it. I'm not some big burly man, I'm an average sized woman, so I really needed the dolly for what I had. \n\nI have my own UPS account, so I print my own labels and UPS charges me directly. I only need the UPS store to do drop-offs. The owner of this location gave me crap for not allowing him to charge me for my packages. He told me that he only makes 50 cents per box when I pay for my own packages. I had to hear an earful about how he makes no money. Uh...I get a discount for packing and labeling my own boxes. I'm not going to pay more than double the amount for shipping just to give this guy more than 50 cents. If part of the UPS store is to allow me to drop off, then just allow me to drop off. That day he only made $1.50 from my transaction. I guess I have to apologize for that, but it turned me off from coming back.\n\nIf I'm coming to this location I either need to come early before work or I rush to get here before the 5:30pm pick up. That morning was before work, so I was in a rush. I really had to hear an earful from him and he gave me crap about using a dolly.\n\nI have been in this store when the owner wasn't around and received good service, but boy I think the owner of this place made a bad business decision if he's not making enough money. I feel bad, but I also feel that good service and a great attitude will take you a long way.\n\nI drop off a lot of boxes, so to avoid this guy I was going back to the one on Linebaugh & Countryway, which is harder after 5pm...I would sweat bullets in Linebaugh traffic wondering if I would make it. The guys over there are sweethearts but the last pick up is also 5:30. Once I discovered the location on Gunn & Van Dyke I took my business there. \n\nThere are days that I drop off 11 boxes or so. $5.50 probably doesn't sound so bad to the store on Gunn & Van Dyke, since he doesn't have to do anything but store my boxes a few minutes before the UPS truck comes.","stars":2}

Not tape the whole box- just 2 pieces of tape for the address label. $1.50/5\" tape. WTF. I had just been there, was told $3 to tape the box, but none of this bs about the label - and Isaac saw no difference between the two, or any reason to give a customer a break. They tried to charge me $13 for a medium sized box, and even to use their computer to print something, supposedly $.5/min, is a minimum $2.50 charge. I used  under 2min, printed 1 thing, charged for 4min PLUS SALES TAX. You've gone downhill, UPS. I used to recommend you, but never again.","stars":1}

Numerous calls and online chats with UPS  customer service have been met with indifference, excuses and \"I\"m sorries:\" but no resolution.  supervisory intervention has not resulted in appropriate service.

{"text":"The worst UPS Store I have ever had the displeasure of using. I used it often for a few months because it is about 5 minutes away from my house. When I shipped an item worth $5000, they lost it. Took two months for the issue to be \"resolved\" (to this day, they have the item as still sitting at their location according to the tracking #), the resolution being a $5k check. I had long lost the business of the client this package was for. Still not sure what in the world happened, as two other packages I mailed at the same time to the same location turned up just fine. Throughout all of the customer service calls, not a single person offered an explanation or any condolences. In my opinion, cutting a check is not good enough, and I doubt much of an \"investigation\" was made, looking back on the discrepancies.\n\nTo top it off, the manager of the store (whose name I don't have, as no one at that facility wears any UPS uniform or nametags) CURSED ME OUT and hung up on me when I attempted to call and find out what happened to my package. How a manager feels it is ok to curse at and hang up on customers, I have no idea.\n\nI have since been using a UPS Store in Sparks 45 minutes away. The drive is terrible, but the service far surpasses that of the Lemmon Drive location. I did report the actions of the manager to a customer service supervisor. Unsure if any corrective action has been taken. \n\nIn short, do not use this facility. Make the drive elsewhere.","stars":1}

However, I ran our of packing tape at home.  So when I entered the store, I told the gentleman I just needed the package taped up, and he said, \"I will have to charge you $2 for tape.\"  This was no big package, by the way, so I went next door and bought my own tape for $1 and drove to the post office to do my business.\n\nOn my last visit this past Sunday, I needed to mail a passport renewal.  I told the young lady behind the counter I needed to mail some papers and it was important for them to not be folded or bent.  She looks at me and says, in the most monotone-sorry-for-your-luck-buddy kinda voice, \"We don't have those envelopes. They're at the other store.\"  So I just stand there waiting for some more helpful information, but all I get is a blank stare.

I knew he didn't know what he was talking about, so I asked the tall, young guy working there, to scan the barcode on my phone... low and behold, the label printed out.  I'm giving this store 3 stars because, the end result was positive.  If there's another UPS near me, I won't go back to this place.  I did know about this store, nickel and diming people, but I thought all UPS stores charged for printing out labels, tape, etc. once, I asked to use their scissors, I was charged $1","stars":3}

{"text":"The staff is friendly but is not reliably able to provide standard UPS services. I wanted a mailbox, I brought the forms filled out and the employee charged me. Then I was informed that I would have to come back to get a mailbox assigned by the owner, who only works 8-1 on weekdays. I then asked for a refund as I can't come back during the limited hours but it was insisted that it would be ready for me when I came back. I was not surprised when a different person was there when I came back, who was unable to assist and asked me to come back when the owner was present.\n\nThe kicker is that I saw these two different employees that were not familiar with the store provide mail directly to folks that walked in and said: \"I need the mail in box number XYZ\". No ID check, no name confirmation. I doubt this is to UPS standards, certainly not mine.","stars":1}

{"text":"I would leave zero stars if I could.\n\n1. I would also recommend that consumers either encourage online retailers to avoid using UPS, or if possible to shop at a local store instead. In our case we ended up having to visit Best Buy in person anyhow. \n\n2. Extremely poor customer service. No way to contact the local UPS office directly via telephone. New drivers not trained to find locations appropriately. I could go on and on but this post is already too long.\n\n3. When the UPS driver cannot find the address there is no place for him/her to state that he/she could not find the address. This causes the UPS driver to make up some other excuse such as \"The receiver was not available at the time of delivery\" or \"the address is incorrect.\"\n\nLie may be a strong word but in this case, unfortunately, it is the truth. \n\nWe never received a phone call on any of the supposed delivery dates and we know the UPS driver was never at our location at the times he stated \"the receiver was not available at the time of delivery\".\n\n4. Poor care of item to be delivered. The box we finally received a week late had damge in several places. (see photos)\n\n5. When an order is cancelled with the online store from whom the item was purchased (in this case Best Buy) AND cancelled with UPS, the item is still delivered and it is the buyers' responsibility to return the item to receive an immediate refund or decline the item from the UPS delivery driver. If the driver does a \"drop and run\" you have no choice but to return the item to a local store, if there is one.","stars":1}

They neglected to tell me that due to the address I was shipping to that the package would be shipped via USPS and not UPS, even though they took over 100$ to ship the package at a higher rate guaranteeing it would arrive.  As it turns out, after tracking the package down through the post office it will NOT arrive by the 25th.  Absolutely unhelpful, and also dishonest for taking money for express shipping and sending packages in the US Mail.   I could have just paid the post office myself and saved 85$.\n\nIn addition they take down personal information like your name address and telephone number and then if you have a question they act like you've never been there and refuse to look up your packages.","stars":2}

He was able to look up the address no problem because my grandmother had forgotten her phone with the address, and he was able to pack up the items very quickly and efficiently. We were in and out quickly. My only gripe isn't with the store itself, I'm just not a fan of the parking lot. The parking spots in front of the strip mall are always taken and cars rush right behind you if you are trying to back out, and the lot is narrow to begin with. Germantown Pike is hit or miss for traffic.

The staff turnover at the store is so fast, it is rare I see the same people in there twice.  But when it is obvious a store employee has done something wrong the manager absolutely will not take responsibility.  We have signed delivery receipts and they deny any wrong doing when the mail doesn't make it into our box.  Checks go missing that are certified.  They left a piece of our mail on the copy machine.  It is a truly horrible location.  And now the store manager is trying to make out like it is one piece of mail when it has been at least two large denomination checks/money orders this month alone. Just more excuses when we have evidence of at least two registered letters this month that made it to their location but never made it to our box. And since these types of customer service complaints have been going on since at least 2015 by others on various review sites it is definitely NOT a one off accident. We have reported the location to UPS store corporate office, the USPS mail inspector, and the BBB providing our evidence. As well as reporting his threat that if we didn't close our box that who knows what would happen to our mail. His threat was very clear and witnessed by others.","stars":1}

A gentleman name Khalid was the customer service employee on duty and the store was completely empty. I walked in with a great attitude and asked to have my package returned.\n\nKhalid then informed me that he should charge me for the approximately 6 inch piece of packing tape that was needed to seal the opened original plastic package. So, I repeated his statement and said, \"did you just say that you want to charge me for a piece of tape?\" Khalid replied that yes, this was what he said and that tape was a supply product and the customer should be charged to use UPS supplies. Dumbfounded, but still calm and cordial, I told him that I frequent this store often and have never encountered this kind of policy. I then said that I couldn't even imagine how much you would charge for a piece of tape. He stated that I keep bringing up the tape but that he would seal the package but I should still be charged. \n\nI am still bewildered by this lack of customer service, his rude attitude and the greed involved in charging people in a neighborhood UPS store. I will not be frequenting this store in the future and can not imagine the greed of this company if a piece of tape is a billable offense to a frequent customer.","stars":1}

Many of them are still wearing the same clothes they had on when they fled from the fire Monday. We walked into the store, they asked what we needed and they refused to help us mail the gift cards, even after I explained what they were for. I asked why not, and the extremely young, lip-glossed, employee behind the counter chirped, \"We're not supposed to. We just can't.\" Then her coworker rolled her eyes at us. I looked at my son and I said, \"We have to go find someone else to help us.\" We walked out the door, crossed the parking lot to the FedEx at Copy, Pack and Mail and asked them, \"Can you help us mail gift cards?\" And they said, \"Why couldn't we?\" I said, \"I have no idea but UPS refused.\" And they did, with great care and concern for the people we were trying to help.\nOn the way out, my son said, \"Did he help us, Mommy?\" I said, \"Yes, baby, he helped us.\" My son looked and the nice man behind the counter and said, \"Thank you for helping us, sir.\" The man smiled back and said he'd be praying for everyone involved.\nIf I can help it at all, I'll never use UPS again. Even if there's some company policy against shipping gift cards, there's no excuse for callous, dismissive, immature behavior from the counter.

In the last few days I had to get more than a dozen documents notarized on four occasions. Sharicma (Shar) Foster was my notary for all of these documents. Despite the number of documents and the fact that she was just about to head home on one occasion, Shar meticulously (you should see her handwriting!) notarized all of my documents. Shar is just one the many great folks I have worked with over the years. \n\nAlex, Justin, Queen - all have been wonderful at customer service during my time with this store. \n\nI get a decent number of packages delivered to the store. If anything is every missing or late, the staff make sure that they take the time to help me figure out where the disconnect may have been. I have also found them to be very objective in recommending mailing services when sending items out. I can just show them what needs to be mailed, where it's going, and they give me a few options that make sense. \n\nThis is not an easy store to work at - though that me be true for most jobs that are so customer-service-centered - because of its location on Penn's campus, the store is frequented by folks with little time (or courtesy). I am impressed by the level of patience that the staff here demonstrate. \n\nAt the end of the day - I know that my mail is in the right hands with folks like Shar and Alex working at the UPS Store. \n\nAlso note: I am a staff member at Penn, and I get a free package and mail service through Penn. I don't use said free package and mail service because their service (and often their customer service) is severely lacking. \n\nRegarding the complaints in other reviews: \nFirst, I cannot relate to any of the mishandled or lost package issues. If anything has ever gone awry, it has not been at the store level. \nSecond, these people care. I know most of them by name, and they know me just as well. \nLastly, I can attest to the pricing of certain things (tape, packaging, etc). These are not set by the employees. They need to not only tell customers this price, but also have to stand their and get berated for something they did not put into place. \n\nThank you, everyone, who makes #2473 an awesome place to do business at!","stars":5}

I do not carry cash so I pulled out my debit card (I know it's only a dollar but I was asked to pay, so there you go).

{"text":"On Saturday 9/18/2021 I went into the UPS Store location off of Lemmon Drive with two QR codes. One was for an Amazon return and one was for a separate transaction (not related to Amazon) - which was a QR code for a UPS shipping label via a 3rd party selling app Mercari. \n\nI believe this store is owned by a family. I believe the older man is one of the owners and he was who helped me at the Lemmon Valley location. I told him I had two separate transactions. I first gave him my Amazon return and had him scan the QR code. No issues there. I then mentioned again that I had another separate code not Amazon for the second package. \n\nI pulled up the QR code underneath the first photo you see attached to my review to which he states it was not a UPS QR code. I told him it was. It shows right above it is, I selected UPS for my shipping preference and have several times before with his wife (who was standing behind him at the other counter) done so and we have never had any issues. She scans the code, prints the shipping label, affixes it to the box and hands me my receipt. He stated that it was not for UPS. I told him that was weird, because again as you see here it states UPS and the location click able link has that location as where to go. He said he couldn't do it and to take it to whatever other shipping carrier bc UPS was not it. He asked to see my Amazon QR code to show me. I told him there was no need. That although I know it is UPS, I'll just take it to another UPS location as there was no need to argue. He kept raising his voice demanding to see my other QR code to show me the differences. I told him no. I will just go to another location to get the package mailed as he has already told me he cannot do it. He said, \"Fine -goodbye!\" I asked him for a copy of my drop of receipt for the Amazon return - he fumbled with his computer and then printed and handed it to me and I left. I never once raised my voice. But he did multiple times in front of my two kids. This owner claims on my Google review I didn't have them with me, but check video we did and they still talk about this rude man to this day. \n\nAfter I left the Lemmon Valley location on 9/18/2021 @ 12:10 pm as seen in the timestamp on my Amazon return receipt. I traveled to another UPS store location of N. McCarran to get my Mercari QR code shipping label done. That UPS store scanned it, printed the label and handed me a receipt in a matter of seconds. I thanked them for getting it processed and brought up my experience at the Lemmon Valley location. The N. McCarran office stated it was indeed a QR code for UPS and that \"even an idiot should've been able to do it.\" That they apologize for the hassle at the other store but it was absolutely a UPS QR code and is super easy to do for anyone as an employee. I even attached my drop off receipt from this location dated 9/18/2021 @ 12:34 pm. \n\nThe Lemmon Valley location needs to watch their customer service tact and attitude. Maybe it was a simple menu error of them trying to scan for Amazon QR codes versus a regular - I am not sure. But that older man truly needs to realize that their business is customer service based. His wife and daughter who have helped me before - never any issues and they have been nice to me in the plenty of times I have been there. But the man needs an attitude adjustment. He needs to take a deep breath and try to help, not criticize. While we all have off days, you can tell by this stores ratings on Google and Yelp that they indeed have some room for customer service improvement to tend to.","stars":1}

I did not realize this until I got home. { sigh } \n\nAfter receiving no response via email from the store's email address, I returned to the store in person. Instead of apologizing, I was berated because my email included an incorrect tracking number.

Otherwise, I would take my business elsewhere.\n\nAs an amusing addendum to this review, I will say that if you need to get your \"flea market\" fix, you should take a step in this store.

This was pre-covid, and the man unpacked the laundered, but used, comforter from my plastic storage tub, laid it on the counter, and folded it into a compact  shape and then assembled a new box to ship it in.  He explained, that the volume, not weight, was what was driving the price up.

They receive US Postal mail on a daily basis and have that sitting in your box by mid-afternoon. Since your are provided with a real mailing address instead of just a PO Box, the store will also accept packages from the various shipping companies on your behalf - and they will send an email to let you know that they have you package ready for pickup.\n\nFor small business owners they offer notary services, copying and  faxing, as well as a variety of printing, binding, packing & shipping, office supplies, and promotional products services. For the average consumer you can also use all of the services mentioned above, and many people are bringing in their Christmas gifts to be packed and shipped through UPS.\n\nI've been a big fan of the UPS stores for many years, and appreciate having this store located in an area that I frequent on a daily basis.","stars":5}

{"text":"WARNING:  Do not use the UPS Store for standard printing services.  I needed two copies of a file printed on card stock...just two...and was charged $16.05!  My jaw dropped.  The store used to have standard copier/printers which worked fine, but they did away with them and replaced them with a mega commercial printer.  Because they used this commercial printer for my two copies, the cost is $5.00 per page, and get this...there's a surcharge of $5.00 for having to use a pull up the file on my flash drive.  Why in this universe the sales clerk would think that $16.05 would be acceptable is beyond me.  Had he warned me beforehand that the type of printing I needed they really don't do anymore, and that for such a small order it would be very way costly, I would have appreciated it.

Once, while he was waiting to be served, the owner was on the phone with someone, yelling and screaming at them, while customers waited to be served, it was a joke, at best.\n\nBut, I digress. One to this experience. The clerk measured the box, and told him it would be over $80 to ship it. He wasn't prepared for that much, but paid it, as he needed to get the box shipped. When our friend returned it after repairing it, his shipping total was a little over $40, also from a UPS store! My husband felt he'd been overcharged, and saw that the measurements on the return trip were smaller than the measurements this UPS Store gave him.\n\nHe stated by calling UPS, only to be told that the UPS Stores are franchises, and UPS actually has nothing to do with them! After much digging, he found the corporate site, and where to complain, which he did. The operator understood the problem, and promised to get back to him the next day, after contacting the store. She never did.\n\nWe found out after many more phone calls, that the local store (Lemmon Valley) wasn't returning the calls to the operator, or any others we had contacted. My husband perservered, and finally found out the store had overmeasured the box, and indeed overcharged us. They said we'd have a check within a week for the excess charges. \n\nWell, a week went by, and then another, and another. To make a frustrating story short, we waited from July until September to finally see a check. We will never use this store again, and will drive the additional miles to use the Fed Ex store in midtown. They are somewhat better most of the time, and a whole lot cheaper, and they guarantee delivery. This UPS Store is the worst ever, as others have noted. Avoid at all the costs, and stay away from the owners, they are absolute jerks.","stars":1}

All of the employees are always SO helpful and answer all of my questions. I usually find myself working with India, who is very professional and goes out of her way to help me. I feel very fortunate that I get such quality of service at this UPS store, and I never find myself looking for another UPS store.","stars":5}

I walked towards the  counter and the woman who was working there her name is Tara Johnson did not even look at me after I said hello and was at the counter. I then diss good morning and still no reply. This time Mrs. Johnson looked at me and took the router from my hands without a word. Walked to the other register and begin to process the router. I then asked if there was anything else I needed to provide in order to  send off the router. She finally replied and said \"as long as you have a confirmation number it's fine\". She did not speak another word to me. I found them to be very rude. It was a fast process. There was a couple also there that were printing and one more person walked in after me.","stars":1}

{"text":"6/2/2020 EDIT:  The package this store obviously misplaced after it was delivered a week ago miraculously turned up today.  No explanation was offered but then again, one would only be necessary if I were an idiot.  \n\n6/1/2020 EDIT:  As if things needed to get worse, today the store is just closed.  No explanation, no apparent pre-planning, they're just not open.  A sign on the door says without any hint of apology that they're simply closed.  Old City is and has been completely peaceful and quiet through this entire mess everyone's going through.  There is absolutely no reason for this store to be closed today, a Monday and a regular business day.  Customers (myself included--though trust me, if there were another option, I'd take it) have packages that we can't get to because they decided to just not open today.  \n\nORIGINAL END OF MAY 2020 EDIT:  The service issues at this store are only getting worse.  You may have seen that someone from the store responded to my earlier review with a weak apology but then spent more time and effort offering a bunch of excuses that don't address the real issue.  \n\nI called again yesterday about a package that USPS delivered to the store on Tuesday.  The person who answered the phone said he can't look up the tracking number because it's a USPS number.  I was in front of a computer and so was that employee.  I looked it up myself.  It took literally five seconds.  So I read from my screen the information that he refused to look up on his screen.  I explained that the USPS status is delivered and I told him the date and time that it was delivered.  He said the USPS is wrong and they didn't deliver it.  Remember, this store had misplaced a different package of mine in just the past week.  I asked him if he is really asking me to believe that the USPS just entered a bogus delivery date and time for a package that they actually didn't deliver.  He said it's \"possible.\"  I said \"Sure, it's possible but it's not probable.\"  He again insisted that the package wasn't delivered and that the USPS tracking information was simply incorrect.  And I again hung up in frustration.\n\nI just went to the store again (for a different package; the one they obviously lost is still lost) and there are around TWELVE people lined up on the sidewalk.  I waited about five minutes and the line didn't move AT ALL so I finally left.  Also, we still don't know whether they fixed the front door or if they're hoping it will magically resolve on its own.  \n\nIt's a small store and they only let in two customers at a time.  It has ALWAYS been a small store and I've never seen a bunch of customers crammed in there.  After several consecutive days of long waiting times for the customers, adjustments need to be made.  Have an extra worker back there.  (We can see back there.  There absolutely is enough room for another employee so don't give us another serving of weak sauce about that point.)  Also, when you have a dozen people lined up out in the sun waiting to come in and utilize your business, it's time to pick up the pace.  Yes, it is possible to work faster and not make mistakes.  We are in a special circumstance and businesses need to flex to meet that circumstance.  This business is not doing so and the customers are the ones who suffer.  Do you think I'm the only customer over the past couple weeks who had to leave frustrated and without my package?  C'mon.  In roughly the past week, I have left the store frustrated after waiting in line on THREE occasions and I've hung up frustrated and with unresolved issues on TWO separate occasions!  GET IT TOGETHER!","stars":1}

Rather than giving my husband any ideas for the next steps, they basically waited for him to leave on his on with no information, no print job and out almost $20. He was given no help as to what to do next. I tried to call and talk to them but they didn't pick up, even after calling five times. Usually I like this place to send out packages, but no more.

{"text":"Went to come make a review about my terrible experience at this location, and realized I am not the only one who has been treated poorly by the employee, Tara. I went to ship two packages, waited in quite a long line -- no worries I wasn't in a time crunch. While standing in line, I watched her pick up the phone twice, and hang up on both calls, without speaking one word to the people on the other end. From the beginning of my interaction to the end, I felt like I was imposing on her in someway, and felt very much like a burden for answering a couple  simple questions a customer might ask - what are my options for shipping and confirming the shipping address - both times I felt like an inconvenience for even asking. At the end of the checkout process it was time to pay, I was not sure when I should insert my card and so I asked, she then said that I need to wait and loudly announced that she's sick and tired of impatient people and made direct eye contact with me. Once I left She shoved my receipt at me. After looking over it the information both from my name and my recipients name were incorrect, even though they were written on the package clearly. After reading the reviews about Tara, I am very shocked that she is still employed at this place. I am not one to hate on customer service, as I know it's a hard job and some people just have hard days, but this is unacceptable with the amount of negative reviews she has received.\n\nUpdate to respond to the reply from the store: okay, but what are you excuses for your employees terrible customer service and rudeness? I love how you completely ignored that part of the review, which was the majority. Do better, good to know you are reading these reviews and not making any changes!","stars":1}

I went to pick it up on December 11 and the female associate said that she had seen it but could not locate it when I came to pick it up. I then asked her to please call two other access points to locate my package. She looked at me and was about to hand me the phone so that I could call. She then begrudgingly called and remained on the line for about 25 minutes. She then handed me the phone without letting me know who I was speaking to you and she walked out of the store. I was left with only the male associate at about nine other people who were waiting in line.\nBecause UPS does not have customer service that is stateside I was speaking to someone in the Pacific Islands. No one could help me and made me feel like it was my fault and the establishment where I bought the item. They kept telling me that I had to contact them and request a refund or some other course of action through that company. The fact that UPS does not take responsibility for their mistakes and carelessness.\n\nI am still without my high priced item that is a Christmas present.\nI will update this review if anything changes.","stars":2}

The customer's spitefulness and lack of insight into their own behavior continued when they left a review here accusing the UPS Store staff of dishonesty. \n\nAt a time when our community was fighting for life because of the devastating fire, the staff remained kind, and patient.

She scanned the second code and said that I needed to seal the package. I asked her if I could use the stapler or the tape that were sitting between us on the counter. She said \"no\" and that she would charge $2.50 for the use of tape. I asked if I could use the stapler. No again. She asked me if I wanted a receipt for the first package.

(He at first told me that they couldn't sign it, and another co worker had to correct him) I had \"fragile\" \"this end up\" written on every single side of the box. I asked for the top to be taped closed (everything else was already taped) and he flipped the box upside down right in front of me.\n\nHe saw the look I gave and went off like \"well it's going to happen. You could put neon signs and they won't read it. The person delivering this is probably some upset kid working 25 hours a week and doesn't care. Not to mention conveyor belts.\"\n\nOkay though, but you know it's a value of over $2,000 and you couldn't bother to read the box and NOT do that in front of the customer? And then openly complain about how shitty it is to work for UPS right in front of your manager?\n\nIf you can't hide how much you hate your simple retail job, you have a hard life ahead of you kid.","stars":2}

I was all for waiting and everyone was being very understanding and patient. After a few minutes she yells at us saying instead of standing waiting we may as well go across town to the other store. Which was completely out of my way and inconvenient.  I ended up leaving just because she was making me feel uncomfortable. Did not go across town but instead will be going back on another day. Hopefully everything will be working and the employee will be calm. I'll give it another chance and see how I feel after that.","stars":1}

Her response to a couple of my questions were snappy and curt.  She printed out my receipt and threw it at me and proceeded to walk to the back.  This woman is a joke and has no customer service skills.  Even though this store is less than a mile from my house, I will not return.  Based on other reviews, this store needs an overhaul.","stars":1}

I paid with cash and left.  The next day when I got to the front of the line at the post office and presented all of my information and paperwork I was told that you cannot wear eyeglasses in a passport photo.  I then paid $15.00 to have them take one which I could use.  On my way home I went by the UPS store at 216 Lemmon drive Reno, NV 89506 to ask for a refund for the photo that was useless as a passport photo.  Tara Johnson started to try to take another photo when I informed her that I had already had a new one taken at the post office & I just wanted a refund.  She rudely told me that \"we don't do refunds.\"  I asked if she was the manager and she said yes, handed me a card, and said \"that is the owners policy.\"  I find it hard to believe that a business does not give any refunds period, especially in a case of flagrant employee incompetence.","stars":1}

I have stopped by several times now and the employees are always nice. \n\nThey only allow 2 customers in the store at a time and you have to wait in line outside but the times I've gone, the line moved pretty quickly.

I brought the return shipping label but didn't put it on because it was USPS and I figured UPS would need their own. The lady ( should have looked at her name) said no they could use the USPS label but couldn't give me a receipt.  I said I need a receipt as proof I dropped it off. She said take a pic of the label. That wouldn't prove I gave her the receiver! She then said well, take it to the post office in the most condescending tone. She could have printed a UPS label and given me a receipt.

{"text":"This is by far the worst UPS store in the history of UPS stores. Do NOT come here. I usually go to the one on sheldon road and hillsborough ave but decided to come here to give them some business for some items I was returning to amazon. Immediately the kid (Zachary) gave me dirty looks as I brought in a box full of stuff. (5 envelops and 4 small boxes) He then wanted to charge me $5.00 to tape up the 4 small boxes that I didn't have taped up, when I asked why- he rudely says to me that tape isn't free. Mind you that anyone who shops on amazon knows that amazon states that the items does not even need to be packaged and that ups will package and ship the items for you. (Just show them the bar code that amazon provides) The manager (JP) comes out and I explain to him my issue and ask is it policy to charge customers $5.00 to tape up a few small boxes and he proceeded to tell me he (the kid, Zachary) gave me a deal because they usually charge $2.00 each box just to tape it up so I was getting a deal! What a joke these two are! I feel bad for the owner of this location since UPS is independently owned! They will for sure shut down at this rate. Do yourself a favor and support the other locations around the area! There's another location right on Linebaugh ave and Countryway that is only 5 minutes away! To the owner of this location- do yourself and your business a solid and terminate Zachary and the manager JP as they will run your business to the ground the way they treat your customers! Never again will I come here and I encourage all others to do the same unless you like getting dirty looks for giving them business and charged for every little thing. Believe all the other negative reviews about this location!","stars":1}
{"text":"A few months ago, the front door started to stick to the point where customers literally can't open it to get in the store.  An employee has to come out from behind the counter and open the door from the inside.  It stayed that way for months and now that it's warmer out, the doors are always just left hanging open.  I don't have any reason to think the door is fixed but that's actually not what prompted me to write a review today.  I went in on Saturday to retrieve two packages but they said they had only one.  I figured I'd made a mistake so I took my single package and went home to double-check.  I had in fact received notification that a second package was delivered.  I went today to pick up that package as well as another that had arrived today.  They had no idea what I was talking about regarding the Saturday package.  I figured this would be the case so I brought the tracking number.  The employee looked it up and saw that it had indeed been delivered there on Saturday.  I was in the store for a really long time, after having waited in line out front in a line for quite some time.  (Oh yeah, there's always a line now.  Understandably, volume is up but a business has to staff up to meet demand.)  While all that was going on, I actually found my other package myself.  After wasting a half-hour on what should have been a five- minute trip out of the house, I was told they have to check video surveillance to find out what happened to my package and I was asked to give them until \"tomorrow probably.\"  I returned home to an email stating that a package was waiting for me at the store.  I walked back to the store and found a line TWICE AS LONG as was there earlier.  From the line, I called the store.  The employees just let it ring until my call was forwarded to some recording.  I immediately redialed and this time, someone answered the phone.  I explained what had happened earlier in the day, that I had since received a message about a package, and that I wanted to make sure there actually is a package there for me because I am once again on the sidewalk waiting in line.  He asked if the email said I had a new package or whether it said it was a reminder.  I had already told him I was in the line out front so it should have been obvious that I don't have the answer to that question.  He however did:  I had already given him my mailbox number.  He could have just typed it into the computer and checked.  It would have taken 15 seconds.  I explained again that I don't want to wait in the line again if when I make it into the store, I'm just going to find out that there's no package.  He said there \"should be\" a package.  At this point, I told him I'll just check tomorrow and I ended the call.  Why would this employee not just check for the package?  And why are the employees just letting the phone ring?  And why is it OK that they aren't concerned about fixing a broken door that keeps out customers?  And why aren't they staffing up to meet the current high demand?  I mean, there are a ton of recently unemployed folks in the city who I'm sure would be happy to get even a part-time gig providing some level of customer service at the UPS Store.  The service delivered today was really frustrating.\n\nUPDATE:  So I went back today.  They had found my package.  (It was indeed the package about which I'd received the email yesterday, minutes after I was in the store and they couldn't even find record of it in the computer system.)  Today, the line was 8 deep outside the store with 2 customers inside.  It took 10+ minutes for me to get in.","stars":2}

To top it off, the store couldn't help us print one piece of paper in the form of a label. \n  We left and went to another UPS store where they couldn't be friendlier and more helpful.  \nI will NEVER return to this place ever again.

In normal circumstances, I would have figured out a different method to get it printed, but as I mentioned before, I really needed to get rid of this package from my home and my presence. \n\nThe location is pretty convenient, off of UPenn's stop on the trolley. When I went in, there was one employee helping another customer. They were both wearing masks and maintaining 6 feet apart.

{"text":"The Woman at the counter is TERRIBLE. I have been to many many UPS stores and mail 10-20 packages a month through UPS and this is, without question, the WORST experience I've ever had with a UPS location. I came to have an item wrapped and boxed and she was on the phone helping a customer. She was explaining to this customer that shipping something to California costs a lot more money than someplace local and after hanging up the phone muttered \"idiot\" quite audibly in reference to the person on the phone. Next I told her I need to wrap and box the item I am about to ship and that it is insured for $1400 (which means I need to mail it out of a CC Center or Hand it directly to a UPS Driver, I cannot mail it out of a franchise location). She charged me for a box, packaging, and one other item that I'm uncertain of what it is (it's an additional special charge, wonder what for). What I was handed at the end of the transaction was a very crudely wrapped and oblong box that DID NOT fit the device that I was mailing. The edges were bursting outward and this was NOT a rectangular or square UPS Package (WHICH I HAD PAID FOR). She gave me a totally misshapen box and if I had mailed it as-is the item inside would have undoubtedly suffered damages. I returned to the office after going to my car to photograph the haphazard packaging and asked her to repackage it in a box that will fit what I am shipping. She replied \"It does fit.\" And I asked if she could just please get me a bigger box and put some extra bubble wrap on it so it doesn't shift around to which she replied \"It has wrapping on it\" in a very condescending tone. Then a coworker who appeared just slightly younger than she was came in and was talking to a UPS driver. After I got the packaging corrected to something more satisfactory I said thank you and explained that if anything happened to it my boss would chew me a new one, just trying to lighten the VERY tense mood. I received a blank stare and a grunt in return and so headed for the door. THEN, just as I approached the door she turned to the other girl, said something and started LAUGHING AT ME. I had half a mind to turn around and go back in and say something but I was extremely busy and did not have the time nor patience to go back in. The receipt says her name is Rita. So if this was you RITA, I hope that whatever crawled up your **** is just as unpleasant as your attitude.\n\nOH AND SHE ADDED TWO \"special ticket\" charges to my total.

Then the little girl employee began to give excuse why she wasn't wearing a mask. There wasn't even a mask on her person or any where near by close!

{"text":"This store by far has the worst customer service I have ever seen I was met by a rude ungodly kept woman with long broken gross purple nails who was rude from the very start I cancelled my transaction in the middle of it and drove 20 min to barring Blvd store and was told my package did not need new packaging as the First \"lady\" told me I did because she didn't want to redo a label for extra insurance long story short I would drive to Carson City if I had to before I ever try to send from there again","stars":1}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  I usually go to The UPS Store in downtown St Pete but I happen to be in the area so I dropped off an Amazon return at this store. There was a line almost to the door but the staff was as quick as they could be and periodically apologized and told everyone they would be right with them, which I appreciated.\n\nWhen it was my turn, the return was quick and efficient. I got my drop off package receipt and walked out the door in less than a minute.  That's where the good steak ended. At the downtown store, I return my Amazon item and within HOURS, I have my refund.  I returned my item on Nov 29 and I just had to call Amazon AGAIN to find out where my refund was. I'm not getting my refund until Dec 13th! I called the store over a week ago, and was told they put my item within a bigger package, so my tracking number is useless. I'm waiting for my refund to order the correct item and now, because I made the mistake of returning it to this store, everything is delayed.  \n\nThe staff is very pleasant but I won't be returning to this store, at least for Amazon returns.","stars":2}

I filed a claim and did not hear back from them for 2 months. Because of this the packaging and such had been thrown away (my bad). When they did reach out they said they would get back to me in 2 days. Never called me again. Claim was denied and clerk was less than helpful and rude through the whole process.","stars":1}

{"text":"\"Is she REALLY reviewing the UPS Store?\"  Why yes, I am. \n\nI suppose I really am biased.  After having two boxes \"disappear\" from my porch (and no, I do not live in the ghetto), I decided to pay extra for UPS MyChoice and have my orders (I have a bad online ordering problem) delivered to the UPS Store of my choice.  Tara knows us by name and will often pull our boxes when we walk through the door.  I appreciate that touch, especially when she is in the middle of dealing with a line out the door.  I have seen some reviews mention customer service but when she is buried with a long line, I cannot blame her for seeming a little stressed.  I have personally never heard her being rude to any customers and she works as quickly as technology allows.  The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars has to do with the fact that she is often alone and SWAMPED.  The managers/owners should really think about adding another employee or two.  She is competent at what she does and should be given some help.","stars":4}
{"text":"I had an amazon return but didn't have a box with me as I was on my lunch hour. I had a paid return label so thought I would pay a few dollars for a box there. \n\nI waited for 15 minutes while not being acknowledged and watching this lady bubble-wrap, tape and box an item that seemed to take forever. Watching her I thought she did not appear very experienced in wrapping.\n\nNext it was my turn. Finally someone came back from lunch and assisted me. I told her I had return label but need a box. She went to back to look for one for 5 minutes. The other lady then said she would find. She brought 3 boxes out; one large, and 2 smaller. She said the measurements looked like it would be better using 2 smaller boxes together. So she uses the two, taping them together. She uses a very small amount of those air pocket plastic filling that she brought out from back of an old garbage bag as if it had been recycled. She used minimum tape to tape the two boxes unevenly together. \n\nShe then rings me up for $39. I said the shipping was paid for. She said this was for the 2 boxes and filling. I told here this is not right. And that I was expecting to pay under $10. She said \"the owner\" will get mad and it's already in the system. I said well $39 is way too much for this. She adjusted something and brought it down to $29. I was stuck at that point and had to pay this for $3 max of material.\n\nI have called corporate and they say they will send complaint to store owner as they are franchised businesses. I will definitely come back to this review if owner calls me back and refunds me the majority of this. For now, bad store in many ways.\n\nPP","stars":1}

It's clean and there's enough stores and restaurants to keep you content as you wait for your flight out of Reno. \n\nThere are also the typical slot machines everywhere, just like Las Vegas.\n\nIf you are arriving, the baggage claim area is small, but your bags come out pretty fast.

So I give him the items I needed to send and asked for a receipt.\n\nI checked the tracking number they gave me from the receipt today and it said it hasn't even been shipped out yet. So I call and the woman I spoke with couldn't even find my package under my name. So I gave her the tracking number and she said it should be shipped out today and in 2 packages! They were 3 small items which should all be sent out together as my return only required one QR code given to me via Amazon. Also, it's been 4 days since i dropped off my items!!!

I have been dropping off all my eBay packages for years at this location in addition to all my UPS needs because the people here are so nice and responsible, so I think they should rethink this policy.

I try to do it as much business as possible with the store because I appreciate having them in my neighborhood.\n\nThey do everything from faxing to printing to shipping and of course they have small post office tight boxes that you can rent for receiving mail.

However she promised me a refund on the money I spent to ship the package but when I arrived to collect the mean owner of the store was very rude to me and wouldn't give me my money back!  He refused to refund me $30 odd dollars.  I paid cash and requested a cash refund so the guy opened the cash draw and said he didn't have the money to pay me and told me to come back another time! I saw a load of cash in the drawer when he opened it.  He claimed to me that he had already spent enough money fixing this problem and he was not going to spend any more on it.  He claimed he spent $500 on this problem but never could explain how he arrived at that figure. He made a mistake and wouldn't see it resolved to the end.   I've never been so blow away by bad service from the owner of the company, he was so rude and didn't care about my fair needs as a customer.

{"text":"Is there anything lower than Poor-Fair? This is a UPS franchise store that a package was shipped from to me. In all fairness the store was not responsible for the actual delivery - the UPS driver was, but the store places a sticker on the box that states something like if this package is damaged do not contact carrier call this store at the number listed below. Well the package was damaged not beyond savage, but the driver dropped the package off at our garage around 6:00 pm - although we were all at home. So we never knew a package was delivered until the next morning after it had rained and our sprinkler system had come during the early morning. So you guessed it - I had brand new wet purchase inside of a big ole wet brown box.   \n\nWhen I called the franchise store like the label said precisely at 8:02 am - I got worse customer service and attitude. I am so glad I was not in this store face to face with the gentleman because it would not have been pretty. I am not sure if he's the owner of the franchise or just a employee, but either way he needs to be fired or close it down. My advice is do not use this store better yet use FedEx at least they attempt to ring the door bell.","stars":1}

It was seriously like watching the postal ballet to witness these guys work together. One was separating my packing slips and labels and entering the computer stuff. In the meantime the other guy was assembling boxes, loading my goods, putting the packing slips in the right boxes, and sealing them up with gusto.

As a member of the clergy I walked into this store on 10/17/2014 to have a marriage document notorized for a couple recently married and was shocked at the ignorance and suspicion towards me that was immediate when I began to request my notarization. For lack of names at this point, the white lady felt compelled to read the entire document and after pretending that she did not understand the reading she proceeded to the back to where she had a black worker to look at the document. They both came out and begin to ask some ridiculous questions along the lines of, where is the married couple and was I the one who married the couple? After trying to reasonably explain that the certificate only required the signature of the clergy and a notary. For no other reason, I was just simply told that they didn't feel comfortable doing it. In short, I think the service at this location is poor and I suspect that there is some racial and racially self hatred overtones of the worst kind involved at this location.

I love coming here, and it helps that they are open more than USPS too. They're super sweet and helpful and I actually look forward to stopping in for anything. I've had passport photos, printed important documents, and mailed various packages. They're always trying to get me the best deal and reminding me to use my AAA discount.\nThe best part is that they're dog friendly and they are walking distance from me.\n\nI've always felt it was silly to review large chains like these but the employees here are so awesome, I felt they deserved a shout-out. Thanks, guys!","stars":5}

{"text":"I was skeptical about using this store because of all of the bad reviews. I was right to be wary because I had a terrible experience here.\n\nI paid for my shipping online so all I'd have to do was bring it in and have it scanned. I brought in my package and the guy at the counter asked if it was fragile because I put three FRAGILE stickers on it. I said yes. He said, I'm just supposed to let you know that we aren't responsible for any fragile packages. What does that even mean?? I send packages all the time with USPS, so I said OK, I packed it really well so it should be fine.\n\nHe scans my package, and I turn to leave. It's dark outside and bright inside. In the reflection of the window, I watch the man THROW MY PACKAGE 6 feet into a bin with other packages. Of course you can't be responsible for the safety of packages when you treat them so poorly. My item hasn't arrived at its destination yet so I'm not sure if anything was broken, but that was exceptionally annoying.\n\nI wasn't going to leave a bad review on this action alone. I figured I'd just never go there again. But then I got an email this morning from the UPS distribution center saying that my package is on hold because it doesn't have a customs form attached. When I purchased my shipping online, the website had me enter my customs information, so I figured it was somehow attached to my UPS label. Nothing on the UPS website mentioned printing out a separate form and attaching it to the package. \n\nI know this store doesn't control the UPS website, but the person at the counter who checked in my package should have caught that and told me that I'd need the form BEFORE taking my package. That's what happens at the post office; they check to make sure your package has everything it needs before they take it. \n\nI don't understand all of the bad reviews about tape. Imagine how much money this business would lose if they gave everyone tape. Buy your own dang tape, you're going to need it anyway. Just don't use it at this UPS store.","stars":1}

{"text":"I really like the convenience and concept of being able to have a one-stop-shop for all my little detailed needs that have to do with business. I can gather up all sorts of things, and in one fell swoop -get a heck of a lot of details done- QUICKLY!\n\nI can take my birthday cards that have extra postage and have them run them through the meter and take care of mailing them safely for me. I can buy a book of stamps, or just one stamp if I need one. I also can make copies here. I can bring in a document I need to fax to someone and have them do it for me for a small fee. Okay, now I can fax and make copies at my apartment complex's Internet Cafe for free, but still; they do it here for you. You also can get a document notarized affordably here. They also do all kinds of printing, from business cards to presentation binders to brochures. They can print anything for you at a reasonable cost. This location also has computers you can rent.\n\nThen there is the service they provide to ship a box of gifts for you. At Christmas-time, I never fool around with the US Post Offices anymore. The lines are always very long, and the time it takes for your gifts to arrive is so slow because it's by snail mail. UPS can do it much faster for you, but make sure you ship early, about December 5 or so, and your item will get there in plenty of time before Christmas arrives. It's a comforting feeling to know it's taken care of, but part of its success is up to you. At ALL places that ship, the longer you wait, in other words, the closer you get to Christmas, the more your gift boxes are going to cost to ship. This higher cost is because you waited too long to ship, so in order to get them there on time for Christmas, they charge more because of the larger volume of people shipping items (Last Minute Charlie's). So, shop early and ship early for the lowest cost.\n\nI love my local UPS office. The people who work here are efficient and professional. A great way to get a lot of work done, for people who don't have all these conveniences at home.","stars":5}

{"text":"I visited this store on November 26th to ship a gift. The female employee was a breath of fresh air - excellent service, genuine, expedient... \n\nOn the other hand...the boy with long hair working the counter was a complete nincompoop - condescending to every customer that walked through the door while I was there, with no exception for me. I use the term \"boy\" because he obviously has not yet reached manhood as he acted like such a child.\n\nHe was rude, disrespectful and abrasive. Between the two employees it was a yin-yang and not in a good way. When one customer asked him about the exceedingly high price to ship across the country he quipped back, \"I don't make the prices\". Well, no kidding! An iota of customer service skills would have been able to come back with a more polite reply and probably would have resulted in the client handing the money over instead of literally throwing it at him on the counter. When I returned the scissors the female employee had given me to assist with the packaging preparation I was doing he remarked, \"I've never seen those before in my life...but whatever.\" When I was signing the document with all of the fine print and actually tried to read it he became very impatient and told me, \"It basically just says what you can't ship just like what you read on the poster on the counter.\" (It says A LOT more than that - I stood there and read most of it) He was visibly TICKED that I didn't just sign it and get out of the store. He smarted off when I didn't move fast enough to come back to the area he wanted me to sign the document, because, by golly, why hand it to me where I'm standing when you can be a complete jerk about it. When I didn't move IMMEDIATELY he said, \"fine...whatever - just sign it over here then\" and slapped it down in front of me. I will not ever go back to this branch of UPS.\n\nI hope he has a chance to grow up someday - and by the way UPS - really? I can get treated like this at the US Post Office - for cheaper shipping rates. Lose the dead weight and hire someone that understands what the words \"Customer SERVICE\" mean.","stars":2}

I said, \"uh uh, no, bring that back.  I'll be packing it myself, here out in the open.  Just bring me a box.\"  She didn't like that and became rude.  Kept grilling me with questions like, \"what's in there\" and \"what are you sending him\".  I kid you not.  This kook actually thought she had a every right to know what I was sending.  I have no doubt that she planned on rifling through my son's bag and possibly stealing something from it before boxing it up \"in the back.\"\n\nThis whole exchange made me extremely uncomfortable, so I took the duffel back and told the girl I was taking my business to the USPO.  The post office only asks you three things....\"is it fragile, hazardous or valuable?\"  That's it!  No one tries to take your personal belongings into a back room, unsupervised.

If you need to return something your ordered, you're going to have to come to theis store in order to send back your package.\n\nSince the pandemic began, I'm sure I'm not the only person who has relied heavily on Amazon for shopping. While I've done my best to support local business, there are so many things that are just so easy to locate and purchase with the click of a button on my phone. But like anything else in this world, some things you just HAVE to return. \n\nThis particular UPS store is very centrally located in the city. You used to be able to make Amazon returns at the UPS distribution center on Jefferson, but for whatever reason, this is now the only location that accepts returns. And they do so graciously. \n\nI have never had a poor customer service experience when returning an Amazon package at the Central West End UPS Store. They make the whole process incredibly easy. You show them the automatically generated barcode on your phone. It's scanned. They take the package. You leave. Simple as that!\n\nI also really appreciate how seriously they are handling COVID precautions.

They are continuing to add services regularly so whether you need shipping, materials, mail service, faxes, or a PO Box, you'll find it all here.\n\nIf you are wondering if it is worth the drive, no matter where you live in West Boise or Meridian, this is the store to choose!","stars":5}
{"text":"My rating is solely based on the manager Esther Kartchner's poor customer service and negligence for our safety. I went in to get a simple copy. I noticed she was not wearing a mask when I walked in. And when speaking to her she poked her head around the shield that was put up for our safety. I asked her to please put on a mask and she said absolutely not \"I don't have to\".  I said can you at least stand behind the shield and she started yelling and rambling about how she is an American citizen and doesn't have to wear a mask and told us to go to a different UPS if we didn't like it. She also verbally attacked us on our way out. This woman is absolutely out of touch. Her poor coworkers have to risk their safety everyday they come to work. Extremely immature and unprofessional. She was the only person not wearing a mask and threw a fit at the mere suggestion of putting one on for the customers and her coworkers comfort.","stars":1}

I told her that their prices were outrageous.  She told me they were comparable to other places in town.

{"text":"Store is nice enough and within super close proximity to my family's home, but I'll go to the State St. location from now on. I took in a package for return to Amazon. It wasn't pre-taped closed but I didn't think it would be an issue because every UPS branch I've ever been accepts and tapes packages with a smile. The older gentleman who met me at the counter without a word of greeting or smile put my package on the scale and began the packaging process. I told him I didn't have any tape at home and asked if he wouldn't mind taping the package for me. He didn't respond at first, so I asked again. He said \"We have tape and I can tape it for you, but I'll have to charge you a dollar for it because we get too many packages coming in like this.\" When I mentioned that my local UPS facilities in LA never charge for taping, he replied \"Good for them.\" Nice. I told him that the charge seemed punitive and that perhaps I should go to another branch and he nearly tripped over himself sending me out of his store and I was all too happy to leave. I mean, I get that it might be a slight inconvenience to tape up a package, but it comes with the territory when you're in the shipping business! And, to charge a quarter, sure, I can let that slide, but a dollar?! For material that costs the store less than a nickel? Nah, I'll pass. It's the principal. And, if he'd offered any sort of customer service I probably would have just shrugged it off, but this gentleman's absolute \"scroogery\" left me heading for the hills, package in hand. My mom says the workers at this location were nice to her when she needed to track a package, so that's cool. Maybe it was just an angry day for the gentleman I had the misfortune of crossing paths with today. Still, I'll take my business to State St. going forward where they happily tape up my packages (for free).","stars":2}

{"text":"Very bad experience with the UPS store. Had an item shipped from a seller in Tampa that used the UPS Store. The UPS Store of course packaged the item, a 90lb Brother Laser copier/printer/scanner. Nice packing (other than using the peanuts that make a HUGE mess-1 reason I use Amazon for about 95% of my internet shopping. NO messy peanuts everywhere) except they failed to put on box \"this side up\" or \"fragile\". Once item was delivered, the UPS guy rolled the package - end over end over end inside my office. Needless to say many parts were damaged & UPS said item had to go back to UPS Store in Tampa. Ok. Only thing is, getting the UPS Store in Tampa to follow back up and keep me advised on the claim? Non-existent. I have to keep following up with them and either they provide a time when they should know more which proves fictitious or they say they don't know when to check back with them. The packing job was bad enough but the service afterwards has been extremely unprofessional not to mention unsatisfactory. Least they could have done is called when they received the printer back, and since evidently they have NO idea how the refund process works, they could have checked with UPS and advised me what to expect time wise while I wait for a refund. But evidently that's asking too much.","stars":1}
{"text":"Horrible experience with this UPS and just UPS all together. So my husband and mother-in-law went to this store on the 27th of July before my husband flew out here in Arizona with me. They packed the tv themselves in a DOUBLE-WALLED tv shipping box from U-HAUL that you can buy if you don't have the original box. Estimated delivery date was the 2nd or 3rd of August. Got delivered on Saturday the 3rd. We noticed the box looked questionable so we were already worried. Open the box and my husbands 50\" TV was shattered. Completely ruined. I've used the U-HAUL tv shipping boxes 2 times before with no issues. They come with foam corner inserts and my husband packed extra bubble wrap in the box also. Started our claim and then we get in contact with this store and we were told so many different things. My husband paid $252.66 to get his tv shipped and be destroyed. They also purchased the $400 insurance since they packed it themselves. They were never told \"you're responsible for the tv since you packed it yourself\" and never offered to repack it so it would be covered. Ultimately we got no money back for the $400-$500 50\" tv that's UPS ruined. Even if they didn't add bubble wrap this tv should not have arrived in the condition it was in. The box looked like it was thrown around with NO CARE. Says all over the box TV SHIPPING BOX, HANDLE WITH CARE, and FRAGILE. No care whatsoever was put into our shipment. No money back. No help at all even from Customer service. I waited 27 min on hold to hear from the Damage Group which still was very confusing. Apparently they can come to your residence and pickup the damaged item but I didn't ask for that so there was miscommunication there. Then I ended up calling again and was able to send about 7 pictures showing the tv, the box, and the packing. Stayed in touch with THIS store #3691 and they were told it was a single wall box that had paper packed in it??? No paper in my pictures and I never said they packed it with paper. Again they told us multiple different things about the tv. Never shipping with UPS again and please be careful dealing with this store.","stars":1}

I don't usually go to a UPS store, I usually go to the post office because I feel its most likely cheaper.  However, since I've been using Amazon, for returns they have a contract with UPS store, so I've been dropping off my returns to the store.

I would rather wait for Santa Claus to deliver my packages than give this store another cent of my money.

However, it looks like this store's policy (Store #3247) is that neither employees nor customers should wear a facemask or face covering.  I say that because the only store employee I saw had no mask, nor did the 2 couple being helped.  I saw a posting on the front door from Pima County giving public notice that employees at this store were observed not wearing masks.  In other words, Pima County knows employees there don't wear masks, and I witnessed the same.  As I was leaving, 2 older customers came in wearing masks, and they looked startled at the situation.  It is irresponsible, inexcusable and unacceptable that this store is not having employees, nor customers wear face masks when we're in a local, national and global pandemic, which is currently worsening.  It is also very common in Tucson that masks are required (all of the grocery stores, drug stores and take-out restaurants that we go to require it)    Yes I could have boycotted this store, and should have but it was minutes before closing, there were no other UPS stores open, and I was out in 2 minutes.  Buyer beware.","stars":1}

But this place wants to know all about you. \n\nI understand UPS is different, but any USPS transaction does not need your personal information logged into a computer. Had I known this invasion of privacy was not optional, I would have simply gone to the real post office and not been grilled for my phone number, name, home address (my address... Not the one on the package??) And more, then to be treated rudely for not complying.","stars":1}

{"text":"May 14, I needed to return an item to a manufacturer. They had sent me a postage-paid label. All I needed to do was pack the box, tape up the box, affix the label to the box and take it to a UPS store.\n\nThere were numerous other options for hooking up with UPS. I chose the store option.\n\nWhen I entered the store, the sole clerk was assisting another customer, but she was filling out a form, so he was kinda free.\n\nHe saw that I had the one small box with label affixed, so he offered to take the package. Then, he printed me out a receipt, and I left the store.\n\nI swear I was in that store -- AT MOST -- a minute. P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!","stars":5}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying that this is a conflicted review. I've been to this store in the past, and although they can sometimes be rather slow, the service has always been good and I haven't really had any complaints. I realize that things can get busy, and sometimes we have to wait to be helped (yes, sometimes we are required to wait. looking at all of you millennials), but then there are instances that really shouldn't be happening. \n      Based on the above, I will explain my issue. My home printer was acting up on me again, and because I needed to print out a bunch of documents, I made my way over to my friendly neighborhood UPS Store (the local library also allows you to do printing, but the quality blows and I believe it's also a few pennies more per page than UPS). As usual, there were people already in the store being helped, so I pulled out my trusty phone to kill some time. There were two employees working, a younger kid with a pony tail and facial jewelry, and an older woman who I always see working when I visit. She finished helping the gentleman in front of me, and so I stepped up when he left so that I too could be helped. This is when things went downhill. \n        Instead of acknowledging me and providing assistance, she quickly turned around and went in the back as soon as the man in front of me left. She could have easily just said hello and then give me the, \"I'll be right back\" standard statement, but she did not. The cherry on top was when I heard her start talking on her cellphone whining about her daughters teacher and how stressed she is with trying to get her into college. I could go further, as she proceeded to gab for at least another 10 minutes while knowing full well that I was waiting, but I digress. It was obvious too that the young kid she works with is scared of her because he too made no effort to acknowledge me or call her out to help me. I don't have many pet peeves in life, but this is definitely one of them. \n       In the end, the younger kid finally helped me as she continued to blab along. He was very nice and helpful, and even didn't charge me for additional printing I needed when I came back in 2 minutes later after leaving because I forgot I needed them. I really wanted to go 2 stars on this location because of her, but stuck with 3 when I had to go back the next day and was helped again by a different younger kid who was even nicer and more helpful than I previous one. Long story short, don't ignore your customers. I realize that we all have personal crap we need to take care of on the daily, but don't handle it by being impersonal and rude to your customers. Maybe she was having a bad day, totally acceptable, but try and remember that you're AT WORK, and your job is customer service.","stars":3}

This location and customer service is hands down the best I have ever experienced. David Davis, the Print Specialist there, made business cards for me and everyone in my company and he was so attentive to the details and my requests. He has been making them for my company since we opened last May. He is a perfectionist and now I will only order all our paper goods from him. He even personally delivered the cards to our company the other day, off the clock, and he absolutely did not have to do that, but that's just how great they are at this shop. \n\nJust OUTSTANDING!

{"text":"If I could leave a zero I would. I am not the type to leave a review of a business even after I've had a bad experience, but this place is off the charts. I went in to print a resume, a simple, one sided color copy on resume paper, a very very easy project that should take just a few minutes to print. I first tried to use the self service copiers as I am fairly proficient at using printers. The black & white copier quality was very poor so I tried the color copier which you can only print on from their house computer that charges you $2 per 15 minutes. Not only did the printer not print my document, but the clerk had to reset the machine which takes about 10 minutes (while I'm still being charged on the computer). During that time they got a rush and they were unable to attend to me so I left without getting what I wanted to get done. I came back today thinking I could give them a second chance. Nope! Not only did the printer not work again and they had to reset it, but I was there for almost 45 minutes to get 5 copies!! The clerk ended up just taking my flash drive and printing my document behind the counter cause he could tell I was getting frustrated and short on time. After finally getting my copies, the clerk takes me to ring up my transaction. This guy really had the audacity to charge me for the computer time on top of the copies. I honestly thought it was a joke as I didn't even  use the computer to print,  BECAUSE IT DIDNT WORK. I understand they get busy and can't attend to everyone at the same time, but I am a patient person and let them handle the crowd first. This store really needs to have their equipment looked at. It should never take 2 different tries and up to 2 hours to make 5 color copies, and especially after all of this, you think he would give me a break on the computer charge. If you need to print, go to fedex.","stars":1}

This error seems unforgivable to me.  All they need to do is put the mail in the CORRECT box!  How hard can that be?  I don't feel comfortable possibly having my credit card bills or other important pieces of mail going into some stranger's hands.   Today it happened again, and I just don't feel secure knowing that these mistakes are made a few times a year.   They are always very polite when I complain, but it's still wrong and potentially dangerous.   Plus, I have the chore of going back to their store to return it so they can finally put it in the right box.  I just hope that when MY mail ends up in the wrong box, the recipient is honest enough to return it to the store.  But I'll never know for sure.  For the cost of the box (over $200 a year), the least they can do is sort the mail correctly, don't you think?","stars":3}

{"text":"You'd think all UPS Stores would be created equal, right??  Whelp . . . based on my recent experience that seems to not be the case. \n\nI'm assisting with an online business that will most likely have lots of future shipping needs and have been exploring my options on pricing, as well as, most importantly ease of logistics on completing my visit.  I recalled this particular location as I frequent this shopping center and it was near my home so I thought let's give it a go!\n\nThere were only 2 other people in the store when I entered and 2 employees working. Not bad, for being in the Holiday season. When it was my turn, I explained what my needs were and that I had a UPS account I would like to use. I was immediately told that they only took pre-printed labels or I'd have to pay there. Neither of these was an option. So I asked where the closest place was that I could actually use my UPS account #. I was told there was a UPS HUB that just opened over on Silverstone. The other employee heard the conversation and didn't provide any commentary. I was given the address and went to seek it out.\n\n25 minutes later, I finally found the HUB and well you guessed it, it is strictly a HUB.  Meaning, its where UPS drivers go to get packages not a place for people to drop off packages. I looked like a total retard walking into their office looking for a place to drop off. \n\nSo . . . I thought, yah know.  It just seems odd that a UPS store can't take an account #. I mean what would be the point.  I looked up the info for another location on McMillian and rang them up and explained my situation. The woman who answered told me they absolutely could help me and when I told her about my experience up to that point she was flabbergasted. \n\nNot sure what the deal was, but I think I'll not risk another 15 min errand taking me 60 min again and opt for another location.","stars":1}

The shop usually has one to two people working and about three to four customers in line. It's not that there's a ton of people flowing in really it's more that the staff take a very long time to process things which creates a build up. \n\nI'm not sure if it's the systems here and/or if the employees aren't trained immensely but there always seems to be an oddly long wait. The prices are definitely higher than if you visit a USPS shop or pay an online label. They sell gum randomly by the pack sometimes here. And the vibe insides is just \"off.\"\n\nThey do sell some shipping supplies in shop and have the option to purchase a mail locker if needed for your living/business situation. Other than that I really don't see myself recommending this spot to anyone for anything.","stars":2}

She was more worried about her phone then speaking with me. When she did address me, she had a snappy tone and was accusatory when I was seeking answers I had. She being frustrated left me alone at the counter in which a gentleman by the name of Matt came over to assist. He was polite, understanding, and calm and helped me through process. While working with him, Elaina interrupted us multiple times and was incredibly rude to not only me, but to him as well. When I told her I was receiving the answers she refused to provide she rolled her eyes at us and said some demeaning things that I am sure she didn't think I could hear. Matt apologized but I stopped him and apologized to him for having to deal with a co worker like that. There was an area Matt wasn't certain of and he grabbed another co worker named Markus and he was nice and helped as well. Elaina then tried to interrupt again at which I told her these gentlemen are assisting and she didn't take to kindly to that and started speaking Spanish to someone. I am bilingual and understood and basically said how poor of a job Markus and Matt do and how they don't know anything. After those two gentlemen helped me, it was a weight off my shoulders, especially after how I was treated to start my visit. Upon leaving, another customer came up to me outside about the interaction and echoed my experience saying it wasn't the first time she had seen that. I commended her for continuing to go back to the store time after time, something in which I certainly will never do again even though Matt and Markus were patient and helpful.

The package was not taped any differently than the way I do for my usual UPS. in fact, it was not taped different than when Zappos sent the item to me - securely up the center opening. Anyway, I rode to the store near my house. The clerk there didn't take a second look. She thanked me and printed my shipping receipt. Now had she told me it was taped poorly, I'd say ok, maybe I didn't do it right. Maybe it needed retaping this time. However, since I'm not new to shipping boxes and this was the first time I had this reaction, I'm annoyed.

{"text":"I hope the owner takes note that all these bad reviews are mostly coming from 2018 and 2019. In other words, this place has slipped from its former greatness.\n\nI haven't ever had a poor interaction with Linda, the owner, although she always looks stressed and unhappy. My experience is mostly with The Jerk who works there. I don't know his name, but I've gotten so I breathe a prayer when I go in that The Jerk isn't working. He's in his mid-20's, very slightly heavy, and has dark curly hair. The Jerk always looks disheveled.\n\nI first considered a call to corporate about The Jerk when I walked in one afternoon about 3 months ago and encountered just 2 people in the store - The Jerk and an elderly customer, a woman in her 80's, I'd say. Clearly, the woman didn't mail things often, because she was standing there, trying to cajole The Jerk by saying self-deprecating things, like \"I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this old gal, who doesn't know how to send a package,\" or \"I'm so sorry I'm asking you so many silly questions and slowing you down.\" She was being very sweet and was driven to this self-deprecating approach, because The Jerk was acting so clearly annoyed with her. It just came off as extremely ageist and sexist. Rather than helping out an old woman, he was condescending, and when he finished, she apologized again, and he replied, \"Next time, just make it faster.\" I wanted to scream, \"Screw you, you jerk. You should be so lucky to move that fast when you're as old as she is. Try offering her some customer service.\" But I didn't, and I still regret it.\n\nThe next time, about a week later, there was a line out the door, but I happened to land next to an interesting physicist and had a nice talk. I took 2 boxes and asked for 2 separate receipts. The Jerk said he couldn't do that. And I pressed him for it. The Jerk asked me, \"Do you mind if I ask you why you need 2 receipts?\" I was too dumbfounded to say, \"Yes, I mind, you jackass.\" So instead, I stammered, \"Because one is for work and the other is for personal.\" The Jerk then handed me one receipt that looks regular and tore an inch off the bottom of the receipt, saying, \"Here's the receipt for the 2nd package.\" Basically, he just tore the info on the 2nd package off the bottom and handed that to me as a receipt. Fortunately, that was the personal package, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was after that, I started saying the prayer that he wouldn't be there when I go.\n\nLess than a week later, I returned with 2 packages. There was only one other customer and when it was my turn, I announced I needed separate receipts for the 2 packages. The Jerk took the packages and handed me one receipt. When I said I need 2 receipts, he said, \"Sorry, I didn't hear you.\"\n\nThe Jerk has now trained me, so that when I go to UPS on the Mesa, if I have multiple packages needing multiple receipts, I unload one package from the car, mail it, then go to the car and get another, mail it, and another and so forth. I wind up taking several trips to the car, mailing in between, to outfox The Jerk who won't give me separate receipts. \n\nLast note: I've been telling my husband about The Jerk. We went to UPS one weekend to mail a box and when we walked in, I breathed a sign of relief that The Jerk wasn't there. Instead, the shorter, thinner guy is there. The interaction was good enough. Just not friendly or particularly accommodating. I needed to make a note about which receipt was for which package, and when I mentioned that, he acted irritated and left my packages on the scale and walked off. I found myself about to make a self-deprecating remark (like the old lady) and stopped myself. \n\nWhen we left, I said to my husband, \"That was the nice one!\" My husband laughed, because he though for sure he had seen The Jerk in action. \"Nope, I said, he's the nice one, if that gives you an idea of what a jerk The Jerk really is.\"\n\nTo summarize, even though I haven't seen the side of Linda that people are writing about, I think it's clear that her management style has resulted in some unhappy, surly employees. The sense of customer service that used to exude from this place has died. Having said that, there is a young guy, a tall, curly-haired blond, about 20, who is there on very rare occasions. If you get him, he's very helpful and friendly and hasn't been corrupted yet.","stars":2}

Everything is smiles and sunshine until then. They lost our package (1 of 4 going to the same destination!) 2 months ago, and ever since then it has been a bureaucratic nightmare. For a while they weren't answering the phone (at corporate 'customer service.') After about a month, they started answering the phone. You have to repeat the tracking number every time you call. I'm so tired of saying that GD number over and over again! Eventually I'd get passed to someone who would tell me something they thought I'd want to hear (\"the check is in the mail\") and then a few days later, I'd realize they lied to me again. I know they're trying to wear me down and make me give up, but what a way to run a business. I hope Fed Ex has better customer service, because that where I'm going next time.","stars":1}

She barked at me and made demands, as if I were serving HER. While in there, I heard the employees groan about a customer behind his back while he went to his car. Great to know all the personalities here are fake. Wonder what they said about me the day I was soaked. The employees resent the fact they have to work, and don't enjoy their jobs.

Well one of the items that was already in a box needed to be another bigger box and the ups store was so kind to offer me a small size box for $15.00! And no that was not because my item was heavy it was because that's what the store manager Victoria has decided to price those boxes. Now I totally understand the price would be a little bit more expensive then Home Depot or Lowes due to the convenience but $15.00 is ridiculous. The manager needs to do better and also provide help for her employees.","stars":3}

{"text":"I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with UPS right now. On 5/25/2021, I brought in 3 small envelope packages to this location to be mailed out to 3 separate addresses. I paid about $8 each to get them sent through UPS. The guy at the counter that afternoon seemed preoccupied and kept going to the back of the store to do whatever work-related job he needed to do right away. When he came back he apologized and proceeded with our transaction. He then asked me if it was okay if the packages go through USPS instead of UPS which seemed kind of odd to me. It didn't matter to me at the time but that's because I didn't realize there would be no way to track it after that. Well, the pictures that were in these packages going to my mother's family never made it to their destinations. All 3 packages were lost. I'm so upset because some of these pictures were dated back to the 1940s and are irreplaceable. I've sent pictures before in the mail and never had any problems until that day.\n\nI went back to the store with the receipts and tracking numbers (which were bogus numbers). The lady at the counter told me that the packages were sent with just the postage. She didn't seem to care. She just looked over to the slot behind the counter and said the envelopes would have been placed there. Didn't offer to look around the store or anything. Just said there was nothing she can do. The weird thing is that I don't remember seeing him place the envelopes in that slot. He walked towards the back of the store with them and that was that. Anyway, what are the chances that all 3 are lost? I'm hoping they just got misplaced and they will turn up soon, but it's been over a month so I've lost all hope.\n\nI just want to say that I will never return to this location again. I've learned my lesson. I will not send old family pictures through the mail unless they are in a priority envelope with a tracking number. I'm done with UPS.","stars":1}

{"text":"Bad customer service. I use UPS to mail most of my packages. Thinking that all UPS Stores had GREAT customer service, I was wrong. \n\nI came in with about 6 packages stacked on top of each other. As I struggle to open the door, the two (assuming) owners watched me as I carried in the packages. One owner was ringing up a customer, the other was twiddling his thumbs near the front door. I was not greeted or offered help with my packages. Finally after standing with packages, I have to announce myself to the owner who is five feet away from me that I would like service. \n\nThere is no reason for me to ever come back here. I will go two miles down the street to the other UPS store to be helped and spend my money there.","stars":1}
{"text":"Quick, efficient service. I've sent several packages from this location. They do not accept Apple Pay yet btw. \n\nA big plus in my opinion is that they offer notary services. She is usually there from 8a-3p. We have used them a couple times for this. Banks used to btaroze things for their customers but they are not as ready to do this anymore unless it is for bank business so the UPS service is very helpful.","stars":5}

Just take it to UPS.\n\nSounds too easy. But it was, and it worked. I took in the receiver yesterday late afternoon. With just my account number, the very friendly clerk pulled up my name, address and the serial number of the receiver being returned. Absolutely amazing!\n\nHe gave me a receipt and advised me to retain it until I had confirmation that the equipment had been received.\n\nI got a text message this afternoon from the provider saying the equipment had been received and credited to my account.

Upon arrival my mother gave all the pertinent information concerning address she was told that it would cost 161.00 if they packed and shipped it or 140.00 if she packed it herself, she was also told that the United States Post Office would not ship it because of its size. My mother left the UPS store with the walker and proceeded to call me in Virginia Beach, Va. I advised my mother and her sister who are 62 and 74 respectively that they are taking advantage of the elderly. I suggested that they should go to the Post Office. Once they arrived at the Post Office they were told how to wrap the package. Once wrapped and presented to the counter the total was 37.00 which included insurance and a signature. My grandmother's walker will arrive in Brooklyn, NY by Wednesday. The UPS STORE should be ashamed of themselves.

One of the employees opened the door to look out and stood there for a moment and saw me getting my purse and the package I was planning to return.  She closed the door.  I did not think anything of it until I got up to the door and noticed it was locked.  It WAS NOT 3:00 PM yet.  A customer that was in the lobby of the store motioned for me to hold on and employee would open after she returned from the back. I timed it --2:00 min later same employee who had the door open and saw me made this silly motion to say she was not opening the door.  Really?? I can tell the customer in the lobby was embarrassed. On other occasions the employees have been less than professional but I tried to over look. Today-I am beyond disappointed.

I still don't feel comfortable to try and send in any high dollar items again after what happened to my iPhone at this location","stars":3}
{"text":"They charge you to print UPS labels which is already a cash grab since they get a commission per package they accept. The overkill is that it you email them a label they charge a $1 documentary service fee on top of the printing charge. It's sad that you can print UPS labels cheaper at FedEx Office cheaper than The UPS Store.

Once she got off the floor to do so, I watched a couple people trying to collect a door and get it into the van they rented. The employee there didn't help them at all, which I know she doesn't have to, but it would be a nice thing to do.\n\nApathy. Apathy is all I felt.","stars":2}
{"text":"For the Manager -- Rachael:  There is only one B/W printer but multiple ways to send print jobs to this single printer. So while one person is at the copy machine the store employees (or customers) can send jobs to the same printer. I was trying to make tax copies on Saturday, 06 March and one of the employees (Ashley) kept sending other people's print jobs to the copier which started mixing their tax papers with mine....think how frustrating that is!  Obvious recommendation is for a second B/W printer that is set aside exclusively for separate print jobs.  \n\nWhy ONE star -- Employee Rudeness: But the reason for the one star is primarily for the extremely rude way Ashley (one of the employees) reacted to me when I asked for at least the courtesy of a \"heads-up\" when sending a print job to the same copier I was using.  After the third time getting a job mixed in with mine, I said, \"Can you please give me a warning before you send a job on top of mine.\"  She replied, \"I did!!\" Note that she sent the job at almost the same time she announced she was sending the print job (within a few seconds). I said, perhaps a 30 second warning would be nice.  She simply replied, \"I gave you a warning.\"  I asked for her name and the manager's name, she gave it to me with a really ugly attitude in reply.\n\nOne Bright Point:  Thankfully the second employee, Jaylease (sp) was obviously embarrassed by her co-workers reaction.  She was amazingly kind and helpful throughout the 30 min I was in the store.  She even waived the cost of my print job which was a really nice thing to do.\n\nThis is a very stressful time for all of us, I understand that well. Especially during COVID and tax season.  But a little kindness goes a long way.  I hope the management will counsel Ashley that a simple, \"I am sorry for interrupting your print job again\" would mean a lot more than, \"I gave you a warning.\"","stars":1}

I called the store over and over one day and never received an answer. I called from the parking lot and got no answer. Entered the building and there were two employees and one customer but they said they didn't answer the phone because they were busy.

Tried another printer, also broken.\n\nI stood for a few minutes while a second employee tried to figure out why the printers weren't working. They asked if I was in a hurry and I explained that I was because I had to get to the clerk's office before work. This task shouldn't have taken more than 30 seconds especially since I was the only customer in the store. Until, that is... a new customer walked in. At that point, both employees started chatting up the customer and left me standing there by the still-broken printer. \n\nI quietly waited another minute or two, fully conscious that I was now being completely ignored and given subtle hints to leave since they couldn't help me (and my project would only give them a few bucks anyway so it wasn't worth their effort). So leave I did, explaining that I would try somewhere else. Employee's response? No apology, no suggestions, no help. Just \"bye.\"\n\nUPS store, what crappy customer service. You definitely lost my future business. OK bye!","stars":1}

I have not only had negative experiences myself I have also seen them treat other customers with extreme disrespect & lack of kindness & compassion on today's visit I was told that I was not allowed to use a stapler to close an envelope because Amazon's instructions are that I deliver packaged and ready for label even know I had my own tape to seal the package after it was stapled the manager continued to be condescending and verbally aggressive \n\nUpdate... Response to UPS Store Comment... I have no issues following amazons return policy and had brought my own packaging as well as tape just incase the store did not want to package as amazon had informed... there was no issue with any of the employees other than the rude behavior from your manager when I asked to use the stapler as a secondary form of closing the packaging before I taped the envelope closed. I was told NO that I was not allowed to use the stapler that Amazon's policy was for me to have it package and prepared to ship prior to arriving. When 3 of my other packages were all to be packed by your store according to Amazon and I missed the one by mistakenly assuming, there was no reason for your manager to be so rude about something as simple as using your stapler... is it your store policy to not allow customers to use your stapler....?","stars":1}
{"text":"I am not happy at all with this store. I go to UPS and pay more because they \"guarantee\" next day delivery. I went in on 10/12/2020 and I told the guy that helped me I needed next day delivery and he said \"no problem\" I had two forms I needed signatures on from an client and they were very time sensitive, my client is an elderly woman and doesn't have access to email so everything needs to be in paper form. The guy, Paul, is his name, long hair with glasses,  said they would be delivered 10/13 by end of day, I left happy. I paid $40 for two forms to be delivered but didn't matter, UPS would take care of it. On 10/14 early morning, I receive a call from my client and she explained the forms never arrived, so I went to the UPS store to ask what may have happened and I'm told by \"Paul\" he can't do anything about it because UPS can't guarantee next day delivery due to Covid. No refund no apology just a blank stare. So I told Paul he should've given me a heads up that next day delivery is not guaranteed, so I would at least be aware of the situation. Paul instead of just simply agreeing or even trying to sound like he gives a crap just says \"well am I supposed to warn every customer that something could happen?\" Uhm.. no Paul, but to the ones who pay extra for next day delivery, maybe? I was then informed by a UPS driver that same day that they do in fact guarantee next day delivery, they call them early AM's. Sounds like Paul doesn't know or care for that matter. I understand that things happen and there is no guarantee in life but come on Paul, at least pretend to give a f***! At the risk of sounding cliche, they lost a customer. I know UPS stores are all their own and have no affiliation with one another, but from now on I will make the trip downtown instead of conveniently walking to the one on the Mesa, and Paul most likely doesn't care, but I'm sure the owner does. Especially when my office has given them plenty of business. Horrible service horrible experience. Don't get me wrong, I know Paul isn't to blame for a late delivery, but if you see a customer already upset in front of you, why would you upset them more by asking a dumb question to anger them further?? Just stop, and think before opening your mouth. Customer service 101.","stars":1}
{"text":"On 11/10/2020 I saw a promotion on the internet, UPS had a promo going for 40% off off packaging using the promo code PIVOT, HOLIDAY or EASY. So I called the customer service line to make sure it was correct as well as can be used for shipments to Canada. The Customer Service Representative on the phone told me it applies to instore packages as well as to Canada and Mexico. I asked him if he know which stores are participating and he told me the UPS on La Cholla is. I drove down to that store all the way from Saddlebrooke to get the promotion and when I got there the staff was rude and dismissive as well as the manager. I took a screen shot of the promotion and she said \"some stores participate and some do not and her store does not.\" And my screen shot did not validate the promotion because I did not have proof but she would gladly take competitors coupons. On top of that... I was doing returns. I brought about 12 items and put them in one box( I did not know you could not do this, they were all bought off amazon.) Only some of my items were accounted as a return and some say pending. So I called back today on 11/11/2020 to ask why I haven't seen the entire refund. The gentleman was nice and stated \"he remembered me and that he was sure that he accounted for all of them\". I asked \"do you know why I didn't get my entire refund and why amazon is saying they haven't received them\" he states \"no you should have recieved them unless YOU gave me the wrong bar code.\" Which is odd because I gave him the bar code for all the items, I even had 4 different sheets printed as well as used the bar codes off of my phone for proof of return! I am very disappointed because not only did I drive 40+ min to see them for the promotion, now I am out on money for returns I did but not receiving my money back and I no longer have the items. Save your time and money and go to a different store or USPS for packaging.","stars":1}

Got there at my appointment time and they didn't even know what a print consultation was, knew nothing about my appointment. I was told their website offers things that they do not have. The UPS is advertising that they are the place to do all the \"ings\" like printing, shipping, advertising etc. for small businesses. Well I needed to print business cards and their in-store POS advertising even says they print business cards - but nope. I was told they don't do that. They can send it out but it will take more than 5 days, but they do not do it as advertised. Then I just needed some pages printed on card stock and possibly bound together. I needed it cut down to a different size than standard 8.5x11, but I was told their paper cutter was broken. Then after waiting over half an hour in the store I was told they could not print anything because their printers were not working. What an incredible waste of time. This place is run by children who do not know what they are doing and they do not offer even close to what is advertised. A complete and utter disappointment.","stars":1}

Tonight, we found out why.  If this \"were\" UPS, UPS would/should be appalled.  It is amazing UPS let's them use their name and logo with such a poor customer experience.\n\nIf it is a within an hour of \"quitting time\" be sure to expect to walk in to someone eating in the back behind a table that will give you the \"stink eye\" because your package shipping needs are a major inconvenience for her day.  Several weeks ago my wife walked up 5 min before they closed and there was an Amazon delivery supplier that was shouting at her for locking the door early.  She opened the door and let my wife drop off a package but wouldn't let the other gentleman drop off his package (all packages were pre-labeled and no purchases were necessary.  I thought maybe he had been rude or she had decided that the store chose not to service \"his type\", but the personnel is equally discriminatory at random based upon whoever is inconveniencing her more.\n\nShipping packages as \"the\" UPS store would be so much easier if customers didn't have to be involved.

{"text":"The customer service at this location in Temple Terrace is lacking, to say the least. After paying for a priority mail order, the tracking number did not work (so I could not locate my package through the entire transit process) and the 2 day delivery that I paid over $10.00 for took 4 days total. Unfortunately my order did not arrive on time to its destination, and my attempts to contact the local store through phone and email were left unanswered.  On a positive note, the national UPS customer service was helpful in tracking down the order and helping me achieve some peace of mind that my package had in fact been delivered on Day 4.  Overall, however, I will not be returning to this store for future shipping needs -- I believe this Temple Terrace store should be more considerate of its customers' concerns from the moment they walk into the store until the package has been securely delivered.","stars":2}

The mailboxes are very expensive here, especially compared to the post office, but I mainly pay for the convenience of being able to have things delivered and signed for by UPS and FedEx as I'm rarely at home to accept deliveries.  (There are so many places that refuse to ship to PO Boxes so it is a shame the Postal service can't offer this same service for a much cheaper fee).

And it is true. I once had a package sitting at the store for more than three weeks and they did not return it; neither were they mad when I finally picked it up. I have a really good impression of the employees. By now, they actually know me personally and we have nice little chats every time I come to the store.\n\nSome more stuff: when you set up the P.O. box, they give you two keys, one is for the post box, the other is for the door to the store. So you can access your P.O. box 24/7. If you want to pick up a package, however, you have to do so during business hours. Also, if you choose, you can get email notifications when a package for you has arrived (although mine did not work at first and I had to tell them to reset it). The store has a great location directly next to Fry's and some other stores and they are never very busy, so there is no long waiting time.\n\nAs for the price, I pay $100 for a small post box for 6 months. I think if you rent it for a whole year, it is cheaper per month. This is cheaper than a USPS P.O. box I think. Also, UPS accepts mail from all carriers. So I think a UPS box is the better choice. I am sure, though, that there are cheaper competitors. I just did not have the time and energy to look for them and settled for UPS.","stars":5}

I've never had to wait for more than 1-2 minutes, most times I can walk right to the counter because I'm the only customer there at that time.\n\nUSPS on main street on the other hand, I've never walked in on an empty queue.  Average is about 5+ people in line at a time, each person takes about 5 minutes, you do the math.  I'm tempted to not purchase from any vendors that supply USPS return labels just because it's such a time hassle.\n\nIf you are in the Manayunk Roxborough area and need to ship out packages, I would come here to this UPS just for the convenience.

{"text":"Don't go. The owner was rude, and it isn't convenient. \n\nThey charge for packing tape, that's the major sin. Why do UPS Stores usually give away free tape? Because the UPS Store is all about convenience. You go there instead of the post office (USPS also gives free tape), so you don't have to wait in line, it's on your way to work, and you get in and out quickly. \n\nToday, I went in needing to drop off a package with a prepaid shipping label. The owner tried to charge me .50 cents for tape. (I needed less than 8 inches of tape.)\n\nLet me qualify my statements a little more: I worked at a UPS Store for two years when I was in High School.  Not once, did we charge for use of the tape gun. I've literally sealed with tape thousands of boxes that people were dropping off for free. Every UPS Store I've ever been too has given away free tape.\n\nWhen I asked why? She was rude and said she gets 100's of boxes a day needing tape. 50 cents times 100 is $50 dollars a day. I doubt she runs through $50 dollars of tape in a day, and I doubt she get 100's of boxes per day. On Amazon you can buy a tape gun with 2,000 inches (56.4 yards) of tape for $16 dollars. Refills are 10 bucks for 4 rolls, pushing the total up to about 10,000 inches of tape for 24 dollars.  Buy three more replacements to bring you up about 34,000 inches of tape per day. (I don't think she runs through half a mile of tape per day). Not to mention that 50 cents is a ridiculous price for tape. Some people use lots, some people (like me) don't need much. AND all these prices are retail! She gets them for even cheaper. \n\nA store policy like this makes me wonder what areas she is also cheating people at. Is she charging for Two-day delivery when ground will get it the same day? Does she skimp on packaging materials? I don't know, but I wouldn't trust her. \n\nA business is in serious trouble if $50 dollars a day bankrupting you. Not that it doesn't add up over time, it does. But GOOD business owners realize that when you don't nickel and dime people, customers are more likely to come back for things that turn a profit. In the case of this UPS Store, that little 50 cent charge means I wont be shipping there (I ship a ton during x-mas), buying stamps, buying boxes, or copying.  They've lost ALL of my Business, and it isn't a big deal to me either, there is another one that's conveniently placed for me (This one doesn't charge for tape). \n\nOne last point, when a potential customer is giving you feedback (Saying that free tape means people will come back for convenience, and thus more likely to have good loyal customers who will buy the profitable stuff more frequently, don't be rude to them. Especially if they have experience at a UPS Store.","stars":1}

A manager told me \"we just bought a new printer/copier so all prices went up.\" \nOkay... Why is it my problem that you needed new equipment? Ups is a million dollar company.. if not billion. Why am I footing the bill? And obviously if you needed a new one it's because the old one got used and you were paid each time a customer used it.

Whether the person working there today is the owner or not, I don't know; either way, RUDE!!!\n\nThere are plenty of UPS stores here in Tucson - do yourself a favor and spend you money at a different one!!!\n\nStory:\nI always scan my shipping receipts with my iPhone and usually upload immediately to Dropbox. In this instance, I thought I hadn't yet uploaded to Dropbox. \n\nSo my iPhone goes through a major crash and all of my data is wiped out. I thought that I was missing the tracking receipt number for a package I had recently shipped.\n\nSo my lovely girlfriend is out running errands and stops by a UPS store to ask about the package, hoping they might be able to look up the tracking number for us.\n\nSo she's at one UPS store near a Walmart, and the employee there is super friendly. Takes her info, offers to text her when she gets a chance to research our problem, etc. That UPS store learns that I had dropped off at THIS UPS store, and said that we needed to check in with this one (since the UPS stores are franchises, owned by different people, different computer systems).\n\nSo my girlfriend, once again being the angel that she is, stops in at THIS location.\n\nInstead of being polite, or alternatively simply stating that the store was too busy to help us out, the employee/owner (blonde hair, over-weight) begins to lecture. Asking rhetorical questions such as \"do you know how many packages ship through here on a Saturday?\" and chastising her for not having kept her tracking number.\n\nNOW I don't expect the store to bend over backwards with our issue, really I don't. The lady could have easily stated she was too busy at the moment, and to check back later, whatever. Instead, she actually did look up and locate the tracking number, but not until she had taken her pound of flesh from my girlfriend, which of course upset her.\n\nLesson for Owner:\nSights like Yelp now exist. We live in a free market society. Hopefully, news of your attitude will spread and you will go out of business! Why on earth did you choose to work in the customer service industry if you can't handle dealing with customers!? We for one will NEVER spend a cent at this location.

{"text":"I have read the reviews and was a bit leary about going to this location...BUT...I went in this past Saturday (9/10) to mail some mail off and ask a printing question. The 2 ladies that were there were super nice and helpful...the tall brunette told me they could try and print what I  was asking for and that they are open til 5 on saturdays and as late as 7 thru the week...which was very helpful. I have went to several printing spots to get my prepurchased labels printed and aligned correctly with no luck and wasted money on trying. I went back again today (9/12) to the UPS store when I got off work and a young gentleman was working...he was awesome. He helped show me what to do to try and get the labels to print...loaded my paper several times and I was successful in the alignment of the stickers. Super satisfied with the customer service both times I've been here. Great job and thanks for the help.","stars":5}
{"text":"Since this is mostly a service oriented business, my review is based on the service they provided.\n\nThe associate, who was by himself, was able to service every customer in the store with a friendly service every time. There were people sending boxes, faxes and I was making copies and printing documents from an email. This associate kept his cool and everybody was efficiently taken care of. I had to go behind the counter to use a computer that seemed more for staff use, and I'm glad they allowed me to do that.\n\nI usually use FedEx office but I found that they have a very limited number of locations in the Tampa Bay area. I was going to make copies at Publix but I found this UPS Store by chance and I'm glad I did.","stars":5}

It was the same price ....and he sent me to a PO further away!  Another customer had to clarify by directing me to the closest PO.  Extra trip for nothing.... Spent even more money therefore on gas!!!!!","stars":2}
{"text":"This UPS store has absolutely top notch service and employees. I came in to ship out a very bulky/oddly shaped item and the two men behind the counter were some of the most helpful employees I've ever come in contact with. I believe their names were Dan and Glenn. They took time out of their day to try and find me the cheapest option to ship my extremely odd shaped package. They gave me many different box options and pricing and ended up saving me some money as well! They even helped me carry the product from my car. Can't praise this location enough. Great service and great people!","stars":5}
{"text":"Great customer service! I came to the door as they were closing. I really needed documents notarized that day. The gentleman was happy to stay open for me and even took a call from a woman asking about mailing an APO package. Since she was coming to the store right away he said he would stay open for her. He told me an APO is usually for military delivery so he wouldn't turn her away. Great guy!","stars":5}

{"text":"Still have not received my reimbursement from this store!  I have been lied to twice by employees of this store, who have told me my reimbursement check was cut and in the mail to them, only to be informed last week that it had never been cut.  I finally went into the store and asked to see the owner, Ike Spears (who has a law practice next door) and was informed he was not in.  I told them I was going to wait for him to come in and lo and behold, there he was, coming out from his law office.  After talking with him I was assured by him that the check had been approved to be cut.  I have called and left messages every day this week and have gotten no return call from Mr. Spears.  Their employee Latonda told me today that they did not know when the check was going to be cut and mailed.  This seems ridiculous to me that they would not be able to find out from their corporate office when this reimbursement was coming.  They owe me just under $1000 or my painting back!  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS STORE!  Even if you take insurance out on your shipment you might not get paid.  My shipment was dropped off at their location on July 9th.  It is now August 21 and I have no idea when the reimbursement will come.  I have left emails for upper management at their corporate resolutions office with no response, as well.  They owe me just under $1000!","stars":1}

{"text":"In March, I shipped a flat screen TV from NOLA to VA which was packed by, insured, and shipped by the Elysian Fields UPS store. It arrived broken due to inadequate packaging (wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap and then free floating in packing peanuts in a box).  No big deal I thought - they packed it and insured it right - this should be easy to resolve!  First of all, nobody EVER answers the phone at the store, never return voicemail, and never return email.  I have called and emailed dozens of times.  I finally had to escalate to the UPS corporate HQ who is working with me to process the claim however even they are dependent on the Elysian Fields store to finalize the claim.  Apparently this store won't even return calls to their corporate HQ.  This place is a total disaster.  It's June 9 BTW and I'm still making calls to get this resolved and my TV paid for.  Go elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to flush down the toilet.","stars":1}
{"text":"I found this place when I was moving back to New Orleans and needed to ship boxes internationally.  I was so pleased with how they helped me with that, so I signed up for a mailbox. Having packages delivered in New Orleans is a gamble and many things are stolen if left on a porch, so having a place where I could have things delivered to is great.  This is also true of important mail.  \n\nAfter several months, I can say I'm even happier now than I was before - they have exceeded my expectations in every way.  They are super helpful and friendly (always carrying packages out to my car, etc.), move quickly yet help all customers thoroughly.  They text and email me whenever a package arrives, and I could have somebody else pick it up if I wanted.  They even called to warn me when a particularly large package arrived that it probably wouldn't fit in a car, saving me a trip.\n\nTheir hours are not super convenient to me, and I've moved to the other side of town, but I'm so happy with this place that I will keep my box indefinitely.  Their customer service is the best.","stars":5}

And money-wise, I did way less damage than I was expecting which is always a perk. Each box arrived at my house in NJ within a few days and with no damage.\n\nThank you UPS for making a typically stressful moving-out task extremely easy!","stars":4}

They put all of my stuff in a plastic bag, put it in a box and then put styrofoam peanuts around it. So all of the items were smashed together, one container broke and covered everything with it's contents. It was a total mess.

He is an employee there.\n\nWhile everyone who works here seems pleasant, they are VERY SLOW. Be prepared to wait in line, and then wait even longer for the employee to complete the task. Perhaps this is due to the fact that everyone who works there seems to be grey-haired, but they move at a retiree's lazy Sunday afternoon pace. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with that, but unfortunately I do not have all the time in the world to get things done. Any USPS post office can get the job done faster, abd possibly for a lower price.","stars":2}

If they do, they don't show it to the customers, which is the foundation of professionalism.

It was extremely important that the package arrive in LA by noon the next day and we paid $50 for that. \nHe ignored me and said that they can't refund me until the package is delivered. But they have no idea where the package is. I called the general UPS number 3 times and was told a different story each time. With computerized tracking, it seems pretty easy to tell me where the package is or admit to losing it. Why they still haven't called me (promised 3 times as well) is a mystery. Never again. Use FedX.","stars":1}
{"text":"This is a perfectly efficient UPS Store that is always well staffed and has courteous employees.  Its a bit quirky in the sense that they sell local (fleur de lis, saints, mardi gras, lsu, etc) items like scarves, necklaces, and things of that nature.  It's just not what I would expect at a UPS store but they are probably helping out a friend or relative by offering the items for sale.\n\nOther than that you can get shipping, copying, office box, and the like services here for reasonable prices.","stars":3}

Needles to say that address was incorrect and was returned. They would not refund my money or reship it to the address I originally wanted, unless I repaid. The assistant manager put me in this situation and will not resolve it, thought it was his fault. He says I signed off on it but he made me and I had trusted him! I will be taking my package to the post office. They have never had an issue sending mail to this address. Do not go here!

{"text":"I too agree this UPS is one of the worst I have ever been to.  I still use them from time to time to be a smiling face to some of the employees because the men who work there (manager/owner??) are some of the rudest, most abusive, vile, and sexist people I have ever encountered.  At least most people try to hide their pain or prejudice, here it is blatant and encouraged.  I actually asked the young woman if it was always like this and she said yes.  I told her I was so sorry she was the target of such obvious sexism and abuse and that she had a right to call Human Resources.  The men literally laughed in my face as well as call me names and try to dominate me.  How come UPS does nothing about this? I understand he may own the store, but the license should be taken away or the store bought back.  It gives the company a terrible name- what country do we live in? Absolutely unacceptable! Not to mention he has lied to my face about charges and I began to call him out and now they charge me less because they know I know their tricks. Guys- what do we need to do to change this?","stars":1}

He also covered my old labels with blank stickers (I was returning something in the original box) instead of having me peel them off or scratch them out with a marker. I'll definitely come back here next time I need to send something.

{"text":"This is a review solely based on the ATT U-Verse return service operated by the UPS Store. \n\nReturning cable equipment is nothing short of an unbearable chore. Thankfully there are wonderful people in the world like Victoria, who come to work everyday with a smile and make these tasks a bit more enjoyable. \n\nThe UPS Store is drab and boring, but Victoria's smile and positive attitude brightened it right up. She was fast and efficient in processing the order, knew exactly what she needed from me, and was extremely personable and friendly throughout the transaction. The world needs more people like Victoria in it, and I hope the next person who meets her will thank her for all her positivity.\n\nI was dreading this return though. I figured they'd need me to help package this stuff up, fill out forms, and jump through all sorts of hoops to turn this back, but AT&T really made this process easy. Victoria scanned the equipment and immediately found my account, which she verified with my ID. I signed indicating that I returned the equipment and she printed verification too. She let me know I should hang onto it, just in case something went wrong and they tried to charge me for it. \n\nI thanked her for her thoroughness and went on my way. It was that easy. \n\nFive stars for Victoria!","stars":5}

UPS will not hold themselves accountable for their mistake and my mother is stuck paying this money.  This is wrong on so many levels.  All they will pay for is \"the cost to replace the letter.\"  What good does that do my mother?  Replacing the letter will not reverse the $7000 charge.","stars":1}

Recently they went above and beyond to help me solve a packing problem.","stars":5}

New policy that your dropoffs are scanned immediately and you get a receipt. When I did that this week, my return was processed immediately by the seller and my $ was refunded. So yay!\n\nWhat makes this place just OK is the parking lot... yes it's a business uptown with a parking lot so that's great. BUT it's a lot that services 11 different businesses plus UPS trucks picking up/dropping off so it can be chaos. And, of course, the perpetual problem that other people don't know how to drive/park.","stars":3}

{"text":"I've been to several UPS stores in the area and based upon the amount of services and supplies this location has, I would say that it warrants an average rating.  It doesn't seem to have as much to offer as the Greenwood location, but is laid out better and offers more than the Mooresville location.  So maybe  3.5 star?  \n\nI do like the layout with the counter area to the right which allows people to come in and move about without waiting in a long line by the door.  However, the amount of supplies for shipping on display near the front seemed somewhat limited.\n\nStill, if you have your items already boxed and ready to go, the staff seemed to be intent on getting everyone helped.\n\nReview #3482","stars":3}

As a result, it's often easier for me to do my weekend errands in the Wissahickon/Manayunk/Roxborough area when I am at their place helping them with chores, yard work, cooking and senior life in general. \n\nPhilly is a city with a heart of gruff kindness. It's not the stereotypical \"let's do lunch/have a great day\" Chiclet tooth smile, faux nice of the big cities on the West coast. \n\nOver the last 5 years, I've made many trips to this UPS Store and there has not been a single time I have not left feeling a little or a lot better about life in general and with a smile on my face. Even if I am just dropping off pre-paid returns for my Nan or for myself, whomever acknowledges the drop off is friendly, courteous and sincere. The place is always busy when I go in yet there is always someone who will come to the counter from the back of the store to check in on those waiting or help someone who looks frazzled or lost. \n\nWhen I have a day dedicated to racing around for my grands and find myself not always in the most charitable of moods as a result, the folks at the Ridge Ave. UPS store always get my attitude readjusted in the right direction. Youse is all good people there. : )\n\nI'll say it-I LOVE THIS PLACE!","stars":5}

I didn't have a choice though, as I needed to return an item and the retailer sent me a prepaid label via email with instruction to drop it off to the UPS store. \n\nI packaged the item up myself and came in to the store. I asked if they could print my prepaid label, they directed me to a computer. After I printed it, they told me it was $2 for the label. In the grand scheme of life, $2 isn't the end of the world, but UPS was making making money off the shipping, did they really need to overcharge for a black and white printed piece of paper? Fedex does not charge to print their labels AND if I were to go to fedex to print the UPS label it would only have been 12 cents, not $2. (Not to mention, the receipt the UPS store printed me was on a label sticker, so if they were concerned with the cost of the labels, they could spring for a more affordable way to print a receipt.) \n\nThe staff guy who taped my label to the shipment and printed me a reciept was friendly, but the service charge for me to log into their computer and hit print seems to rub me the wrong way in terms of customer service.","stars":2}

They are attentive and give amazing customer service. And they're always so helpful and have the most cost-efficient ideas for shipping, copying, etc. \n\nThey have a ton in stock-tape, packing materials, fun stickers, and funny cards. They also have envelopes and all the office supplies you could ever want! And they're always well-stocked. \n\nThere's also rarely a line unless it's move in/out season at Tulane so it's super efficient. And even when there is a line, they move you through it very quickly. They're also really patient with the spoiled school brats and unappreciative business patrons. So more power to them!\n\nThey go out of their way to help you too. They taught me how to fax (sorry I was born in the 90s and didn't know how)--didn't make fun of me or anything but walked me through the process and waited with me. They created my graduation invites for me (which took several tries on card stock and computer sizing trials). \n\nI once forgot the address of something I had to ship at home and they let me email them the address and shipped it for me so I didn't have to come back into the store. \n\nThey also just have a nice conversation with you instead of rushing you out the door and waving you to the window like the post office. \n\nIf you need to ship, fax, copy or just have a laugh, THIS is the store for you.\n\nMy only complaint is the parking lot is super tedious-way too many cars packed in small spaces and no one ever drives the right way in or out!","stars":5}

So, I boxed it up with the remote, taped it closed, and drove over to the local UPS Store in the Summit Square Shopping Center in Langhorne, Pa.  \n\nI walked in around 5:30 pm.  The time sign said it was open until 6:30 pm.  I was the only one there, and I did not see an employee until I was near the counter in the rear of the shop.  At that point a woman came out from the back area to see what I wanted.  She saw the box and the telltale return shipping label.  \n\n\"You want me to take that?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. Can you handle this return to Dish?\" \n\n\"We can.\" \n\n\"Great. Thank you.\"\n\nI placed the box on the counter, and she grabbed it, slid it over the weighing scale, and pushed it to the side.  \n\n Not another word was exchanged between us.  No \"thank you for your business, nor \"have a good evening.\"  She seemed mildly put off that she had to do something without direct compensation from me.  I guess this project didn't deserve any courtesy.  \n\nI shouldn't complain unless the box doesn't arrive at its destination.  But, for all she knew, I planned to return tomorrow with a truck load of business for her. \n\nNot!","stars":2}

{"text":"I was a loyal customer of this store until yesterday June 25th. I'm a senior with admittedly limited tech knowledge but I'm still a paying customer who does not deserve to be publicly criticized in a condescending manner. To elaborate: I was in this store to print a return label but for whatever reason this was unsuccessful. I was attempting to understand why because it was urgently needed, a reasonable request. The clerk I was dealing with was new and unable to explain the problem much less resolve it. I reasonably asked that he or I talk with a woman staff I had prior and reassuring experience with. This impasse should never have been allowed as my need was obvious to two other staff (one the woman I described). But it did before it turned truly horrible when the other MALE staff announced in public: \"You're in here A LOT. You're always asking for help. Try learning to do certain things on your own.\"  The store was not especially crowded but it could've been . And THIS staff was not even attending to me. And even if he was, THIS PROBLEM WAS CREATED ON THE STORE END! And by the way, I had a similar problem with printing a screen shot when I did interact with this staff and again the problem was on the store end and THIS PERSON COULD NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. And I still went back!  And they lost an Amazon return the two days prior!  The person who made such a public disparaging statement towards me may not be there as long as I was the stores customer, but for his IMMATURE UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR (which he had zero awareness of!) I'm never going back NOR SHOULD YOU! A customer ALWAYS deserves respectful, sensitive service. It is never a level playing field. And IN ANY SOCIAL CONTEXT, such publicly announced statement from someone you're not even interacting with would have been offensive. A staff behavior good and bad represents that store's reputation AT THAT MOMENT AND BEYOND. And THIS staff's immature outburst had a consequence for me and I'm letting you know this store doesn't deserve your business either if this is the kind of employee it entrusts it's reputation in.","stars":1}

However,  the manager made what should have been a quick, painless package drop off, into an extremely uncomfortable encounter. He's extremely rude, treats customers like they are inconveniencing him, and worst of all, literally yells at his employees in front of customers.

The only inclement weather was HOT.  I don't mind paying a regular shipping price BUT paying for guaranteed OVERNIGHT Delivery to be delivered 6 days later seems RIDICULOUS.  IRONICALLY, a second package was sent the same day from a different location but sent via FEDERAL EXPRESS and guess what??? THAT PACKAGE MADE IT ON TIME and crazy part was it didn't even cost as much!!!!!  I truly understand that if there was truly inclement weather and package unable to leave - I get it, but it arrived at 6:30 a.m. and was just 20 minutes away!!!!  I even called trying to go get it myself and I was given the run a round everytime.  Just Ridiculous.\n\nUPS Truly dissapointed us by not refunding money on a SERVICE THEY FAILED ON.  We said we would pay for regular service and they still denied.  So Wrong. \n\nFED EX is my new go to.","stars":1}
{"text":"They demand to know what is in your package... not if it is a hazardous material, like at the post office. They straight up demand to know what's inside for \"safety\" reasons. I'll never go back.","stars":1}
{"text":"Love shipping from this location. Always kindly greeted and I'm able to get in and out quickly.  Some shipping locations charge money just to drop off a prepaid package. They do not. They always offer a printed tracking slip even when I'm not paying them anything to drop a package. Highly recommend.","stars":5}

{"text":"Although I have a UPS account the UPS store does not carry the correct forms or airbills for account holders to actually ship anything.  I was told to go outside and wait as a UPS truck would surely drive by and then I could ask the driver for the correct form.  The employee walked me outside however there were no UPS trucks around. They told me to log on to their computer and I could download the form from the UPS website.  Easy, right?  After sliding my credit card to get access to the internet I was unable to find the form that I needed as I did not have my username and password to log on to the UPS website via my personal account.  I paid a little over $6 to use their internet service for nothing else but confusion and slight frustration.  Both employees must have noticed the confusion on my face when they told me that \"the UPS store is not actually a UPS store\".  Silly me...... Instead I went to Montecito Executive Services in the upper village.  They handle both fed ex and UPS and have all the forms one needs.","stars":1}
{"text":"Even though this location is less than 2 miles from where I live, I will find a different UPS location to use from now on. Awful customer service every single time I go and any issue that might come up, it's always UPS's fault not theirs. It used to be great but I'm not sure what happened.   It would be different it it was bad just once but this is every  time I'm in there.   It's sad to see a good company like UPS be represented this way.","stars":1}
{"text":"Ups charges 70.00 for overnight.  Or 35.00 for two day.  My package arrived on time but unfortunately my ups man put it in my mail box.   Then  my mail man in error took it.  ( it is against the law to put in any mailbox).  Needless to say my important package came 7 days later even though i paid for 2 day.  Refund NOPE.... Ups is not responsible for their drivers errors.  They take money for over night and 2 day but NOTHING  is guaranteed.  I paid for a service I never received.  1ze18f800288408299.....    not to mention there is a 5000 to 10,000 penalty for putting something in my mail box..  they are saying no guarantees due to covid.

If you are patronizing this store it's probably because you have to, but if you have a choice I highly recommend you use the Montecito Executive Service in the upper village.

They sell all the packaging materials you'd need, plus they have a service to package and box your items for you if you choose. Check out their other office services too. Love Them! Highly Recommend Them!","stars":5}
{"text":"Very friendly, fast and convenient. The owner and employees are very personable and helpful. \n\nIn response to Beth's review, as a fellow business owner..why would a business give you something free? At your job do you give away your companies products for free? I understand the tape YOU forgot was a small amount but for the employee to give his employers supplies away for free because he should feel sorry for you is theft and could result in an employee losing his job. \n\nMy suggestion for you in the future is to be better prepared and expect nothing for free. Yelp reviews should be a rating and review of the business,employees and service, not on what YOU failed to do and how the business did not bail you out and not commit crimes for you.","stars":5}

{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever. Tried to print something online to the UPS store. It was a resume. When I got there, the paper was much thinner than I expected it was also binded and I had not checked binded. When I got to the store there was a disgruntled employee who was having a tiff with the other customers in the store. It took a while to be greeted. One guy was kind of nice and acknowledged me but then went back to helping the other customers. Then the disgruntled employee came to help me. I said I was there to pick up a printing job he said oh I should have recognized you by your picture. He said I left you a voicemail did you not get it. I said no, I was working. He said well this is what I've got here, and threw Around several copies of my resume half hazardly . He said I didn't know what you want I couldn't tell I don't know what you want I'm not the print guy. I stated that I wanted it on something thicker and that the binding was not correct. He showed me the thicker paper he had but stated that it probably wouldn't run through the printer. The paper was also yellow around the edges. I looked at it and just kindly indicated that would not work. He then said I'll give you $10 and you can take this copy and take it somewhere else and get it printed exactly how you want. He threw a $10 bill at me and stated that he had spent a lot of time on that today. I will never enter this store again. His tone was very rude and horrible to say the least.","stars":1}

Her attitude is phenomenal , she's a great greeter , she always makes me laugh , and she has great communication skills. I've shipped a lot of things and everytime I come in I go straight to Nesha I believe it's time for her to take off her trainee badge shes awesome.

{"text":"Inept and rude staff.  Go to Montecito Executive Services in the Upper Village instead or use FedEx.  My \"guaranteed\" overnight package shipped at their store arrived 2 days late. Apparently the UPS stores are independently owned and operated so you have to deal with the store staff where you shipped the package if you have a problem.  When I called about my package (after leaving a message for the manager a few days earlier which wasn't returned), John at the desk said \"the manager won't be here until next week\" \"I'm the only one here and I can't sit on the phone doing this\" and hung up.","stars":1}

They were all shipped the same day and should have arrived together. All but one of my packages arrived last week Thursday. I called the store Friday to follow up and the agent was able to simply look up my tracking number by name and phone number of shipper. I called yesterday 5/19 and was told by the manager she couldn't look up my tracking number. I tried to tell her yes you can, that someone else did it either no problem. She started getting loud and over talking me then she hung up in my face. I called back again as I still didn't get an answer as to where my package was. She hung up again and on the third attempt they let voicemail pickup. Hands down the WORST customer service ever! I paid over $1100 in shipping costs, I deserve an answer without attitude please.","stars":1}

When it was my turn, the lady called me to the counter and she was very helpful. I needed to have 2 different packages wrapped, packed and shipped! She took the measurements of the items I had for the boxes and made sure I knew what would be happening next. She made sure to separate the items so that they would be paced in the correct boxes and confirmed addresses with me multiple times so here wasn't any mixup. Overall, it as a quick transaction. I left my items at the counter knowing they would be packaged and sent out that day. Normally, I like to wrap and package things myself, but I have just been so busy lately, so this was a perfect solution. I received email confirmations that my items have been shipped and I will continue to get shipping updates. Oh, and when I was at the counter, she also helped me get my account information updated (name, address, email, etc.). Such a great experience! I will definitely use this UPS store often.","stars":5}

We found out the next day while applying for a business license that this store is not actually in Chesterfield, but the Town and Country jurisdiction.  The price for a license in Town and Country was substantially higher than Chesterfield, so I reached out to Jerry to see if we could get a refund.  I wasn't very hopeful, but he responded back quickly and said he would be willing to refund us everything besides the startup fee.  I was shocked and very thankful, because I know he did not have to do that.  Because he was so helpful with everything, I'm sad we are missing out on doing mailbox business with him.  You will not be disappointed at this store!","stars":5}

I decided not to ship my package because of her terrible attitude and poor customer service. In addition, there was a BIG sign on the door asking for customers to adhere to the 4 person only maximum for capacity. She was extremely pleasant to the \"regular\" customer that walked in completely disregarding the rules. I'm assuming he a regular customer because she called him by name, smiled at him, and proceeded to continue her snappy flow of customer service to me.

While Joanne was filling out the fax form she asked my girlfriend if it was going to the welfare office without my gf ever mentioning anything about welfare.  That comment was the last straw for me and I will never return.  When I confronted Joanne over the phone she denied ever saying that.  I realized I wasn't getting anywhere with speaking with Joanne so I called back and spoke to the owner.  Unfortunately that got me nowhere either and after I told him I was going to write to UPS headquarters and write a bad review, he said \"You do what you need to do Andy\".

Completely untrue (not to mention really lacking common sense). No one who works at UPS #4364 could figure out how to enter a ship-from and ship-to address to calculate shipping???

First they blamed the issue on the online print software, then they blamed the machines. On my fifth visit to the store I was spoken to condescendingly by a different woman and offered both misprints, neither of which would be acceptable to the doctor's office.\n\nOn no occasion was I offered a refund, and although they tried several times to reprint for me, all of those prints were the same defective ones.

The owner and the older female (manager I believe) have the worst attitudes not to mention the younger blonde who says there's nothing she can do to make UPS put a sticker on the door where the package is... right because you have UPS plastered all over your store you cant complimentary track it? Not to mention when the manager was standing by the door and the manger was in the back and said \"she will wake up back there\" then screamed her name like what??! You know she's busy you couldn't just help out. No wonder the employees are miserable. I just will never deal with them again I'll drive to Avon. They appear to jack up prices to a completely unethical amount of money and I can't deal with attitudes like that anymore verbal or non and I'm glad to see I'm not the only one because I was very reluctant to write this. FYI the public library does FREE scan to emails and $3 Fax cap you heard me the most you'll pay for any amount! Cheers Yelpers","stars":1}

No one greeted me upon entering and I seemed to be interrupting a very unprofessional conversation where sex toys were mentioned. To make matters worse she answered her cell phone in the middle of my transaction then proceeded to get an attitude when I told her there were spelling errors on my shipping label. I come to this location whenever I need to ship things and I have never experienced such poor service. I will be calling to speak with a manager later.","stars":1}
{"text":"Awful customer service. I needed to return a vacuum after the company sent me a new replacement. I had it all boxed up and the prepaid shipping label. I parked in front of the store, unloaded the box and took it inside - juggling the large box with one hand while opening the door with the other - and said I'm going to park, I'll be right back. Came back with my baby in my arms and was immediately told I had a FedEx label. \"Oh, ok. Well, fudge.\" was my response. I actually said fudge but still got dirty looks from a lady behind the counter. I then said I would go back to my car and come back for the box.  After getting my baby back in the car, I drove up to the front of the store. When I went in, literally every worker looked up at me and gave me a dirty look. The younger man who was \"helping\" me before, an older man and the lady I mentioned. I grabbed my box and walked out. No one ever offered to help me with this large, heavy box. And I don't know what the dirty looks were about, but they were all rude and left me extremely unimpressed. Is it so old fashioned to help a mother with a large, heavy box? I don't think so.","stars":1}

Three weeks later I finally receive package and on box someone had written \"RTS never picked up\" which I suspect means it was placed in package pickup section of store. Mistakes happen, but if the woman had bothered to look in first place maybe it would have been found a lot sooner.","stars":3}

The fact this wasn't waived when I retrieve my file in less than 30 seconds is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. Save your time and money and go to a Fedex office store, staples, or ANY other print shop. Will never go to again for any printing service or shipping.

I no longer had to worry about my important mail floating somewhere \nout there~lost in the world! What I am most impressed with is the attention to their customer's needs. Often, in the midst of assisting another person, I have seen them briefly greet someone as they enter, always with a polite and friendly \"I'll be with you in a moment!\" This is welcoming as well as reassuring. Over the years, I have witnessed numerous interactions with customers~some in a hurry, unhappy with cost of a package or delivery time, etc., each handled with genuine care and respect for the customer's needs. \n\nThis is what sets The UPS Store/Montecito apart from other shipping/mail establishments; the customer is a person who matters, not just a box number or another package shipment. I am confident that with the leadership of manager, \nSaima Bari, she and each employee will not only deepen their commitment to creating excellence~in every way possible via a myriad of services available~but \nby building the spirit of a great store!","stars":5}

With multiple locations we use local UPS stores and have been very satisfied with the level of customer service. Well, until we recently opened a new location in Brownsburg and started using this one. For the past four weeks I've been into their store at least four times a week dropping off multiple packages.  They never offer to assist with holding the door or bringing product in. The two associates (male and female) that are in their 20s, should seriously consider getting a new job. I have personally watched them standby while a woman trying to carry multiple packages, struggled opening the door. These associates do not so much as even try and help customers. I asked if I can borrow their cart and they said they had boxes on it. I explained that I had more than 20 packages between 11 and 25 pounds and she was not willing to take a few boxes off and let me use it....","stars":1}

I still have that box to this day, even though I have moved and it's all the way across town for me.  I see no reason to change to a different location.\n\nFriendly, helpful personnel.  I love the call in service that will let you call first to see if you have mail before you head over there; not a service I use much, but I am glad to know it's there.\n\nI use them for printing when I have a large project that I don't want to use up my regular printer at home for.\n\nThe prices are a little on the high side, but not unreasonable given the convenience of having all my shipping and receiving needs taken care of all in one place.  \n\nThis is not the fault of the store, but watch the area at night.  Lots of weirdos hang around there.  The center mostly contains downscale stores like a few loan stores, a liquor store, and a beat up supermarket.  \n\nPlus, the shopping center's car park itself is rather oddly designed, with only one entrance and exit onto Keystone and strange traffic flows.","stars":4}

{"text":"I shipped an expensive Sony LCD television to my father in in another state as a gift June 24, 2013. I purchased a TV-specific box which met the UPS standards for burst-weight rating and size and packaged the item using corrugated cardboard spacers, kraft paper, and bubble wrap. I took it to the UPS store to ship and purchased insurance for the value of the item. I asked the store clerk to verify that the item was sufficiently packaged, he stated it was. I sealed the item, paid over $250 for shipping and insurance alone and left.\n\nI traveled to my dad's state during the item's transit to visit him and arrived the day the television did. The box was severely damaged (and left with our neighbor as we were at the airport) in such a way that it should not have been delivered, it was clear the item was damaged.\n\nI contacted UPS (on June 28th) to file the claim and packaged the TV up only partially because after removing the TV and seeing the damage, the box was so badly damaged I was not able to repackage the item the way it was when it arrived. UPS initially denied my claim stating ONLY that packaging material was insufficient and the box used was not strong enough. I appealed this decision and picked up my TV from the UPS store after several weeks as a courtesy to them; it was in WORSE condition than the first time. There was almost no shape to the box, there was a new hole and an extraordinary amount of damage and because the television was NOT repackaged properly by the inspector in the delivery state, the TV was damaged WORSE than when initially delivered (cracked frame, external speakers snapped off, etc). To top it off, it was repackaged UPSIDE DOWN in the box, delivered RIGHT SIDE UP. It was very clear to any reasonable person that NO amount of padding inside would protect the contents from the abuse, negligence and mistreatment the package was subject to.\n\nBecause the UPS store owns the shipping account, neither UPS nor their adjuster Crawford & Company would speak with me, noting their privacy policy and stating I had to get the store to do this. The owner dodged calls, refused to help stating \"this isn't our issue\" and the store manager did the same knowing FULL WELL they are obligated to present the claim and any appeal. In SEPTEMBER I was finally contacted by a manager of the UPS store who had ignored DOZENS of emails and calls to his email address and every of the three stores he works at near me (I have documentation of this) and he provided me only an email to submit photos to and CC'd the store owner claiming ignorance as to why I was trying to blame him because he initially forwarded me the adjuster's request for photos (but FAILED to provide an email or a working phone number). The # for the claims adjuster went to voicemail each of the nearly two dozen times I called and I was never ONCE called back by that adjuster despite numerous voicemails.\n\nThe photos were submitted September 17th, 2013 and after a week of no response I continued to call the adjuster, finally giving up today and calling Crawford & Co's corporate line. While they would not discuss the case, the agent DID state that the adjuster had been contacting the owner of the UPS store, telling them to get a hold of me with the decision. I called the owner and she passed the blame to the same manager who initially failed me, stating that he was supposed to have contacted me weeks ago. To top it all off, my appeal was DENIED. I was not contacted once without pressure or threat of legal action on my part and was never given the final notice of decision. Over and over, they denied any involvement and in one email told me that they were no longer a responsible to the claim (assuming because they gave me information to contact the adjuster, who refused to speak with me). At once point they called the adjuster, instructing her to speak with me. I was later informed that due to their contractual agreement, they do not have the authority to make such a request.\n\nAfter everything was said and done, the manager (John Masters) offered to extend my private box contract at his store for one year, a whopping $200 value to settle my claim for the $1500 television and the $284 I spend on GROUND shipping service + insurance. Not only this store and the manager in particular but UPS as well have acted negligently and in bad faith selling me insurance they did not intent to deliver on and are in breach of contract for refusing to perform their duties as the account holder to represent my claim against UPS and Crawford to completion.\n\n\nAVOID the UPS stores in Tampa Palms, Cross Creek Blvd and Wesley Chapel on Bruce B Downs, they are ALL owned by the same person (MAHTANI, SUNDRI M) under the corporation MAC DISTRIBUTION INC.","stars":1}

I simply came in to purchase 6 boxes to pack up some of my stuff. $43.00,  ZERO smiles or friendly conversation from the store clerk, AND a used box later, I've concluded that the customer service here is average at best. They literally sold me a used box that had tape on it. Of course I didn't notice until I got home, and perhaps I should have called, but I'm in the middle of moving and that wasn't a priority.

Have overheard (just by virtue of being in the store) employees complaining loudly about other employees and airing co-worker issues in public.\n\nHave attempted to reach the store owner to complain, but have never received a call back.

{"text":"I have a policy not to give five-star reviews the first time patronizing a business, but now that I've been there twice, I can safely say...this is my \"go-to\" UPS store.

I can hear a smile over the phone.  I'm impressed and I don't impress easily.  \n\nI had barely wrapped the two glass bottles in the box going back to Amazon and Marissa again comes to the rescue.  (Can't we get her a nice UPS cape?)  Although I arrived just a few minutes prior to closing, the same great customer service with a smile.  No urging me out of the store because they're about to close. Taking time and care with my package. \n\nI heard through the grapevine that the previous owner did not operate the store in the manner in which it is being run today. Therefore, I would urge those who previously had poor experiences to give this location another shot, as they have more than earned my patronage, they have truly earned their five-star rating.","stars":5}

They almost all came back with postage due -- the ones that didn't were sent with postage due on the receiving end.

{"text":"With so many other options, go somewhere else. As other reviewers have said, most of the employees are very efficient and nice. There is one employee who is a noticeable exception, however. I cannot fathom why someone with such an apparently inherent foul temper and lack of patience would go in to customer service. I have given her the benefit of the doubt and returned to the store. That was a mistake that I caution you against. She has been consistently rude and unhelpful. She gives snide answers to innocent questions. Interacting with her is like an ironic role reversal- she is like that super snotty, rude customer, but the irony is that you have to become the enduringly patient and solicitous customer service agent to even be able to get a simple question answered. I will not return to this store again. There are just too many other better options to abide by being treated so rudely. I advise the same for you.","stars":1}

{"text":"If I could give this a negative star I would have. Staples closed so we used store to ship an item.  Looked up rates on ups website to get rates.  My wife came home to find out that it was $18 more to ship a package already prepared to ship by me.  \n\nMy wife told me it was double the rate the ups site quoted me.  I called the store to inquire and was told I'd have to call back to speak to\nManager. When I finally got a hold of the manager he was very rude and advised that he is allowed to charge  more than double the normal insurance rate      When I asked him if that is published in the store anywhere he very angrily said come in and get your $18 back.  No way to conduct business or treat a customer.  I think they are used to dealing with people that don't mind getting taken advantage of.  \n\nNeedless to say I was uncomfortable to even go back.  And no there is no sign stating they can charge you more than double for insurance even though ups lists them as a retail\nLocation and not independently owned.  I would rather run in 100 degree weather for hundreds of miles to hand deliver my package than ever give this place business again.","stars":1}

My husband called this location and was told they were running a special - a $20 set up fee and $20 a month - the special was that if you prepaid for a year, you got 3 months back. In other words, you got 12 months for the usual cost for 9. When he spoke with them on the phone he was very clear we'd be renting the mailbox for a business, so we'd have a street address.\n\nMy husband was tied up for the afternoon so I went to the store to sign up for a mailbox. After spending about 20 minutes filling out forms and providing more information than required to get a drivers license, I was told, \"oh, the set up fee is $25 and the monthly fee for a business is $30 a month.\" When I said that wasn't what we'd been quoted on the phone, the guy helping me just shrugged his shoulders.","stars":1}

When I go to these types of places, I usually bring a big sack of patience with me, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the hustling and great customer interactions happening. I had to drop off a cable box (this is apparently one of the drop off locations) and they knew exactly what to do. They gave me a receipt and told me to hang on to it, because the cable company has been known to charge people who aren't able to show a receipt. His advice was super helpful and I appreciated the honesty. The staff next to me were helping a man find the cheapest way to ship a package to Europe and were doing their best to find him a deal.

I called this store in advance and informed them of my arrangement and to ACCEPT the package should I not get there in time.\n\nThey REFUSED because \"they had too many packages at their store to keep track of.\" Moreover, that because I didn't do business with them that they didn't have any obligation to me.\n\nThis place truly doesn't care about UPS customers and is only called The UPS Store in name.","stars":1}
{"text":"I must say this is one of the best shipping places I have been to.  Even though there is one in my current home town, I prefer going to this location (about 10 miles away) if I have errands to run.  They keep enough people on staff to help (although I still may have some wait, it was reasonable.)  They also keep the place looking like a professional business and have a variety of services to help for those things you may have forgotten if you packaged the box yourself.  No pressure sales, but just friendly suggestions.\n\nThe only negative is that they have a location that makes getting in and out a little iffy when it gets busy.  The lot entrance is very near the entrance of the shopping plaza and if someone is following too close or if a line is waiting to exit, you may not be able to get pulled in without risking a fender bender.  And they also allow parallel parking behind the pull in parking which doesn't allow much room for your car to back out.  Probably can't do anything about that unless they relocate, but it is one thing I would have done differently if I was setting up the business.\n\nReview #1761","stars":4}

{"text":"The MARYLAND HEIGHT UPS STORE is without question the most unprofessional operation I have ever encountered in 15 years of shipping antique clocks. A damage claim was submitted same day as delivery of the clock 'on-line' to UPS. The Main UPS Damage Exception Group requested specific details and pictures of the carton, the packaging and damage incurred. 22 large and clear pictures were sent to UPS for a $100 claim on a $308 insurance value. Clock door splintered, damage to the movement, dial, bezel and hands. Following their inspection, UPS sent me another email saying they had COMPLETED their inspection and have forwarded the information to the 'shipper', which I have now learned is the actual UPS Store in Missouri. The gentleman from whom I actually purchased the clock and who packaged and shipped the clock to me has been to that UPS Store 5 times to obtain some kind of resolution following the 'inspection' of the shipment.. The only person at this store is 'Janine' who apparently can only run a copier and maybe sweep a floor? She refused to assist this gentleman, stating \" the manager is gone and wont be back for another week and I can do NOTHING!\"  What?  \"And even if she was here, this claim would not be resolved for at least 30 days!\"  This claim is so cut and dry that it isn't even funny. UPS couriers MANHANDLED this WELL PACKED clock in a, heavy duty DOUBLE WALL CARTON CAUSING its DAMAGE!  Apparently, the UPS Store Franchise Owner is the one who would get 'nicked' for the claim, so this jackass is going to do everything in his power NOT to take responsibility or PROVIDE ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE or ASSISTANCE to the gentleman who actually paid an inordinate amount in just shipping cost (not packaging) to this Maryland Heights UPS Store.  I have been shipping via FedEx Ground/FedEx Home Delivery for now 12 years, and NEVER would that company behave or treat their valued customers in this fashion! That has been MY EXPERIENCE. I have now informed the gentleman who sold me this clock that I am at the end of my rope with UPS.  UPS here in San Francisco told me to tell the gentleman to go back to the UPS Store in Maryland Heights and REQUEST A CALL TAG NUMBER for pick-up at my home in San Francisco of the packaged clock for its return to him.  Guess what?  The UPS Store (Janine) is refusing to issue a pick-up Call Tag number!  I have filed 2 complaints to UPS Corporate who oversee the UPS Stores Franchises. This isn't over!

{"text":"I guess I am joining the crowd here with high praise for this UPS store.\n\nWe have used there services a couple of times - mostly for routine sending of small items and Amazon returns. The store is small, but is a full service UPS station. Staff have always been very helpful, knowledgable and courteous. \n\nOne incident really nailed to for me. I had a large heirloom hope chest that I needed to send to a relative back east. We saw that this store did large item shipping so we contacted them. Boy did we get excellent service far and beyond my expectations! The store manager came to our condo and picked up the chest at no extra charge. They took it back to the store and hand crafted a custom shipping box. It was expensive, but not outrageous - in the $200 range. The chest arrived safely and undamaged within a week. \n\nThey are open seven days a week and provide just about any printing, shipping, mailing, labeling and stamping service you can think of. I am one very satisfied customer.","stars":5}

{"text":"Horrible customer service. Whoever the overly-tanned man that looks like old leather is, he is a gigantic condescending dunce and he does not deserve your business. \n\nI have come here two times, and these two times my experience has been the same. He's rude, not helpful and incredibly inflexible. Both of these times I was trying to ship to Mexico and I was going to pay over $100, which was fine by me and... Guess what? Both of these times there was a reason as to why I couldn't ship anything. This second time that I tried to ship was what did it for me. \n\nHe said that I wouldn't be able to ship the gift I was shipping because it was made in China and by Mexico's custom laws, it would be retained and they wouldn't give it back to me or send it over to the recipient. He basically denied me service on these premises and told me that if for some reason they delivered it, the tax would be huge. The first time was something along these same lines. At this point it almost feels like he's denying me service because of the place I'm trying to ship to, rather than some valid reason.\n\nI took my business to USPS instead and surprise surprise! The gift got there in 2 business day without any hiccups, delays or crazy upcharges. I wonder where is the huuuuuuge tax that he said they would charge me (up to 500% of the value of the gift) and how was I so lucky to be able to ship something that I am legally allowed to ship  (a small drone for personal use) without a problem. \n\nIn a few words: Don't waste your time here and go elsewhere, this guy and his attitude are not worth a customer's money.","stars":1}

I thought it was a joke at first, but a few seconds of an awkward pause, I realized that this was actually happening.  I bought a whole roll for the same price and did it myself with more to spare. The employee was apologetic and said it was a new policy per management. Shame on you, management.

The inside of the box has each side lined with thick styrofoam, and lots of bubble padding around the dishes.  \n\nI went to UPS because I remembered the commercial about packing and shipping for you.  As I inherited this set of dishes while on vacation from NYC visiting family, I needed someone to package them for me.  The cost was high, as expected around $100 for the 22 pieces to ship to NY, but I am highly impressed with the care that was taken. \n\nI will note, that I had to come back a second day to speak directly with Seth, the guy who manages packing and estimates.  I tried dealing with another lady who admitted I better come back because she didn't know how to help me.  Hence, giving this location a 4 star.","stars":4}

Had to wait a day as no Notary on Wednesday. Went back today, Thursday after calling to make sure that 1. the notary was still there and 2. the hours he works = 12 - 3:00 pm.  Arrived at 2:40 and was told the Notary person had \"just left\" even though I could see him at the computer in the back room.  I COULD SEE HIM!  Counter lady said \"Oh, that's not him\", when I pointed him out after recognizing him.  I asked for the name of the owner of the shop and that is when the Notary got up and came out to provide his services saying he had to go to another store for an errand and why he was leaving early.  Only he didn't leave, he was still there, and these stores are independently owned so he probably was lying about that as well - they both lied!   I hope whoever is the owner of the Gateway store does not own another as he/her makes very poor hires.  Do not go to this store.  Worth it to go elsewhere.  Any business that lies to your face even when you point out the lie - and then does not apologize for the lie and turns the negative attitude back on the customer needs not be in business.

I have never really needed one but it sure is nice to know they're are there when ya need them.  \nI had an extremely important packet of paperwork that needed to be Notarized and mailed.  I had stopped my faithful Chase Bank branch to ensure a speedy and free notary.  Despite my being a customer here for decades ( as well as having literally TENS of dollars in one or more of my various accounts at all times) I was denied a free notary.  They not only had to refer me to another branch but I was assured they would charge me over 5$ to help me.  So...i turned to the internet!  Turns out the UPS store does this sort of thing for just over a dollar.  \nI went to visit one of the many branches in my area and this one is going to become my go-to location.  Not only for its proximity to my home, but the fact that it is next door to my favorite pizza in town (NYPD.  Read my review for this place too)\nAt any rate, the people there were incredibly friendly and courteous at every turn.  They were able to help me get my stuff sorted and even offered me to mail my packet for me.  Since they were so helpful, I decided to take advantage of their next day air.  Since it was late in the day, They actually steered me away from a costly next day option saying that it would arrive at the same time if I went with a two day.  What ever they did...it saved me like 10 bucks, all my stiff got where it needed to go and the world is a better place.  Thanks UPS!!!","stars":4}

{"text":"I have a lot of experience with this UPS store. We had a business in Arizona for many years and used this location for more than one box. Over the years, they have generally been dishonest in all services provided to us. Mail was not sorted on time and delivered to the box. Based on the postmark, it was often withheld for more than a week. This can be very damaging to a business and at times it cost us money as a result. Even time sensitive Express Mail packs were held up because they were too busy to tell us the truth in that the pack had been received and was ready for pickup. We had to wait an extra day and spend extra time chasing down the mail. Packages confirmed as delivered by the USPS were claimed not received on more than one occasion. When we questioned the owner about this, she became defensive and rude stating that their policy does not include a guarantee of any level of service, only to receive the mail. I do not believe she comprehends English. Eventually, it was necessary to cancel our boxes and go elsewhere. After doing so, she refused to forward the mail, even when we offered to pay all costs! It was necessary to complain to the USPS regarding the mishandling of our mail. The USPS told us we were not alone. Apparently there had been several complaints about this particular UPS store. In the end, we lost a lot of important mail. They simply did not do the appropriate thing and return mail to the sender when they refused to forward. We can only assume the mail was simply tossed into the trash. I sincerely hope this review helps someone who is considering doing business with this UPS store. You would be better served going elsewhere.","stars":1}

Two days later I called and spoke with a pleasant staff member who confirmed my package was there. I told her to please hold it for two days, no problem. A problem arose when I arrived at the store in less than two days and the item had been sent back less than an hour before I got there. The manager was running around the store and on the phone frantically looking up information on the counter computer. I asked why she sent it back and her reply was that it had been more than five days since it arrived and that is their policy. Needless to say I was upset and frustrated. The manager offered no apology and the poor staff member felt very bad since she was the one I spoke to most recently. I said I wanted the package retrieved and I won't be paying a new shipping charge. The girl took my number and said she'd look into it. All the while the manager kept talking on the phone and staring intently at the computer screen. I will never give them a penny of my business again.

{"text":"The attitude of the employee was not helpful on 7/11. I know those who aim to serve with a full heart as opposed to being lazy-spirited and fault-finding toward customers. My helpful advice is: train your employees on specifics and details on how to guide customers equally and kindly and to go over and above.  A sweet benefit is that you won't have to charge for little things (like pieces of tape from what I've read of the reviews) because customers will flock to your shop and encourage others to do so, which will more than make up the difference. Customers are just trying to accomplish a task; the least you can do is train your employees to show customers what your pattern for a knowledgeable customer is, should they need to come in again. In addition, for employees to take out their \"beefs\" on color of skin, lack of knowledge, or appearance is to make business fail and not flourish. Have the latter as your goal - then you will see the importance of training and testing that training in real time, which will also guide employees in future jobs, remembering what UPS did for them.","stars":2}

{"text":"I made a yelp account just so that I could write this review. I have experienced horrible customer service with this store. I brought in two packages to be shipped 8 days ago now. They were bridesmaid gifts with the girls names written in 6 inch block letters on the box (hard to miss) . After triple checking they went to the correct people, I was reassured and left after paying $40 for shipping. My friend called me on Wed that she got the wrong package with our other friends name on it. I was VERY upset, however called UPS and asked to speak to a manager. There was no manager on site so someone called me back the next day. She said she could create shipping labels for the girls to ship to one another or give me my money back. I asked to find out what price would be to ship. She assured me she would call me back before 4pm that day to settle the problem. I was never called back. I called the next day and was told a manager would be in in a few minutes, so I left my name and number. I was never called back and it's now been 3 more days. My friends packages are going to be 2 weeks late at this rate!!! Thank goodness my packages were shipped to friends not random people or I would have lost all of the stuff inside. This place is incompetent with horrible customer service.","stars":1}

More fool me for not comparison shopping first. When I questioned the 5425 Broadway UPS franchise store owner Scott Goldsmith about his pricing he assured me he was \"inline\" with other UPS stores. After, I pointed out that a nearby UPS store was WAY CHEAPER he said it was because some smaller stores had lower prices to generate more business. Absolutely true. Buyer  beware.","stars":1}

I start to leave and realize I didn't get a tracking number so I turn back around and as the phone starts ringing I ask the girl if she can give me the tracking number. She's pacing around looking for the phone, never looks up at me, and just holds up a finger for me to wait while she's still looking for the phone. She answers the phone, gets on the computer to print out my tracking number and is just chatting and laughing away with the person on the phone. Prints out the number, holds it oit to me while still on the phone and this girl still has not so much as turned her head in my direction.\n\nWhat is wrong with people? If your not good with people - and you're very. clearly. not - don't work a job where you have to serve them. \n\nI walk out the door then decide to let her know that her service was seriously lacking. She's still chatting on the phone so I just shout out to her that it's really unprofessional to be on s personal call while you have customers. She rudely snaps back that it's \"actually not a personal call, it's my manager and it's really important!\" I point out that a manager should know the importance of serving customers and she ignores me and snottily says to the person on the phone, \"she's yelling at me because I'm talking to you.\" They hang up and as I'm explaining to the girl that it's unprofessional to ignore your customers while you're laughing on the phone and the girl tells me that I'm rude and that she's \"the best at customer service!\" \n\nSeriously, this girl is the poster child for the bratty and entitled.

{"text":"I needed to renew my passport.  \n\nI sent a print order (6 page B&W PDF) to this UPS store via the online print order portal (you would think that's where you do it - you would be wrong). When I went to pick it up a couple of hours later over my lunch break, they asked if I could email it to one of their personal accounts.  A passport application.  With my SSN printed on it.  After that, the staff just sort of existed around me for 20 minutes (you know, the usual, walking out the homeless people trying to apply for jobs, talking to each other behind the counter), and then they finally told me that the person who presses PRINT doesn't come in until 4pm.  I asked if they could get my passport photo at least taken, even though it wouldn't be printed until 4, they could at least get it into the queue.  They messed around with the camera for another 10 minutes and then told me it was broken and to come back at 4.  I get it, nothing happens here until 4.\n\nFast forward.  At 4:30, I arrived expecting that printing a passport application, taking a photo, and putting it into the mail would take ~20 minutes.  You would think that, but here again you would be WRONG.  I was there for another hour and 20 minutes!  The person who presses PRINT is apparently also the manager, notary and passport photographer, and juggles all of these things with a level of multi-tasking abandon that is both disconcerting and completely inefficient.  So, not a great experience.  Also, another customer, who was getting every individual page of War and Peace notarized at the time, grabbed my passport application to help me staple it, and wouldn't let go even after I showed her that the staples have to go into the page exactly where her fingers were.  I realize that's not UPS's fault, but the general level of chaos arguably exacerbated my inability to explain to her that I was about to staple her fingers to my mail and be done with it.  At that point I started to share empathetic looks with other customers who were clearly equally baffled at the level of ineptitude involved in the most fundamental of postal-oriented tasks.\n\nHere's the cherry on top, folks.  I got an email today from the State Department that my passport photo is unusable and I have to send in another.  Did I mention that I had expedited this whole thing??\n\nSo yeah, in hindsight everything except for the photo failure makes for a good story and I would have left it at that.  BUT.  Here's my issue: I shouldn't have to pay for another photo, much less priority shipping, AGAIN.  I have already done this one completely frustrating time.  You shouldn't be able to advertise that you can provide passport photos (or printouts) if YOU VERY CLEARLY CANNOT.","stars":1}

The UPS Plumbgate Plaza office said it couldn't be done (which really didn't make any sense). Kevin at this UPS #0949 immediately knew what to do and handled it like a champ. Very knowledgeable, professional staff at this site. No wonder there was a line - it moves fast and is completely worth the wait. Don't waste your time at another UPS office!","stars":5}
{"text":"UPS Nazis. Convenient location but they will bite your head off. \n\nGet in and out as fast as you can.","stars":1}
{"text":"Originally called to have them change an incorrect address and was directed to follow a wrong path that led to a lot of frustration and many wasted hours on the phone.\n\nCalled them back the next day and spoke to a very efficient and responsive employee that was apologetic of the mistake and took care of my request with ease. Happy that I was finally able to be helped and very appreciative of customer service minded employees!","stars":4}
{"text":"Ugh. Don't bother with this store - go to the UPS store just down the road at South Meadows where you will be treated with kindness and respect. This morning I stopped by this S McCarran store to get some documents notarized and the associate was unbelievably rude to me from the start of our interaction. She spoke to me aggressively, refused to notarized my documents while accusing me of lying, and then raised her voice as she walked away. This is certainly no way to treat people. I went 5 minutes down Double R to the South Meadows UPS Store, was treated with professionalism and kindness, and was able to notarize and ship my documents. I encourage you do to do the same.","stars":1}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years as it is fairly close to my house. They get the job done although sometimes the attitude of the staff isn't the best. Bubbly cheerful they aren't.","stars":3}
{"text":"I never would usually leave a review for a UPS store but Deron was just outstanding and I felt the need to voice that. Thank you so much for such a pleasant experience!","stars":5}
{"text":"The driver hasn't delivered my last five packages and they were sent to this facility ***they were eventually sent back to sender because I didn't know where they went because the driver never left a notice. This location did not offer assistance and has terrible hours for anyone that has a job during the day. Customer service is less than helpful. They could not figure out why the driver won't leave a slip or even attempt to deliver. They never returned my phone call. The woman I spoke with took my tracking number on Wednesday, September 25th and stated she would call me back- it's now Saturday, September 28th and no response yet. Very disappointed in the service I have received and have set Amazon preferences to never utilize UPS again. Would advise everyone with Amazon to do the same. \n\n**also the staff at this location was an older woman and a younger man who were both super rude saying I live in an unsafe area where the driver probably didn't feel comfortable delivering. I'm baffled at their comment. I live in a very expensive part of town. Their comment was unwarranted and I hope they receive some proper customer service training.","stars":1}
{"text":"I am so upset. I shipped something from this store on May 4th and then I received a call from my aunt telling me she never received the package. I go online and see that the label was created but never sent. I call to the store and find out that twelve days later the shipment hadn't even been packed yet. I asked about a refund and the woman said a flat no. After nudging a bit more she said she would have to ask the owner about the refund. So I ask why would you just say no in the first place. Such a bummer because they are so close to my house. I think when we go to a UPS store we expect UPS quality service, and that doesn't include allowing items to sit around the store for almost two weeks. I wonder how much longer they would have sat there if I hadn't called....","stars":1}
{"text":"In response to the UPS Store response:\n\nSorry without a solution really isn't a apology. Charging for a service is expected since your are a business. I am aware of having to pay for services. However, be that as it may, NOTIFYING your patrons of the charges they are incurring BEFORE the service is best practice. If you want to compete with your competitors, you have to do better. The man who assisted me told me it wouldn't be a problem and at that time he should've advise me of the additional charge. I suppose it doesn't matter because I will not be returning.","stars":1}
{"text":"This store is horrible! It stinks, literally the store smells HORRIBLE!  Secondly they charge for everything,  I've never been charged for the use of small strip of tape.  Didn't use this location, nor will I ever!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"Here's the thing. I got to this location all the time. The guy that used to be there was amazing. The new staff acts like I'm wasting their time every time I walk in the door and they seriously need some training on customer service. \n\nToday was a great example of their bad service. We made an appointment online for a notary. Went in at our scheduled time and the employee said \"oh we don't have a notary\" to which my husband replied \"I made an appointment online\". She went on to tell us that's a corporate thing and the store doesn't abide by that but we could go to another store. My husband is incredibly nonconfrontational so we just said okay thanks and went to leave. As we were leaving the employee yelled at us \"it's not my fault\". \n\nAre. You. Kidding. Me. \n\nHow rude can you be? We didn't yell at you. Didn't curse at you. We just said okay and went to leave. That response was completely uncalled for and quite frankly ticked me off. \n\nGet your employees some proper training and get that chip off their shoulders.","stars":1}
{"text":"Complete idiots! I went in to return a package, and they mailed it back to my house for no reason. The return address is in a completely different state. Smh.","stars":1}
{"text":"Ugh what a crummy experience!  Although I put most of the blame on the parent UPS rather than the UPS store.  This started out by my having to get a 2 lb package to my wife who was across the country in 2 days.  The UPS store told me to ship this 2 day air, and the price was $72. A bit steep, but I didn't have time to shop around (later I learned that USPS and FedEx both offer cheaper 2-day solutions).  I sent the package out on Thursday, and the 2-days made it a Saturday delivery.  I tracked the package, and the UPS website said the delivery would be \"normal\", but I noticed that on Saturday the package was no where near the destination, with no current updates.  I called the UPS help line, and they could not offer any explanation either.  So it's clear to me the package won't meet the delivery date.  I asked if they would deliver on Sunday if they missed Saturday, and the answer was a resounding NO.  I asked if the package couod be picked up on Sunday if it was in the destination warehouse, and the answer was also NO. Finally the package arrives at it's destination in Monday...a four day delivery with no explanation for the delay.  I applied for a \"service guarantee\" refund at the UPS store, and was told that UPS corporate handles the refunds, and a check would be mailed in about 10 days.  The refund check arrives in that timeframe, but the refund amount is only $66.  I call the store again to ask why the descrepancy, and got an answer three days later that the $6 is for the Saturday delivery charge, which they do not refund.  So much for a custormer service guarantee...this is really cheesy.  High price, slow delivery, poor tracking and less that 100% refunds.   I'm glad there are other options out there!","stars":1}
{"text":"The store just opened up about two months ago. Ive seen business pick up as time goes on. No wait time and the staff is always on hand.","stars":5}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this business!  They have helped me numerous times during the pandemic. Because of my age, my doctor has recommended that I not go into stores during this time. The staff here has gone above and beyond to accommodate my needs, allowing me to leave things at the door and processing everything over the phone. They have always been kind, friendly, and extremely professional. Highly recommend!","stars":5}
{"text":"I always love coming to this location the girls are always so friendly and helpful. I came in to drop off our older router to have it shipped back to spectrum. It was super easy I was in and out in less than five minutes the girls are always so helpful with every project that I bring in for them if it's take me my boxes they do it LOL they rock thanks for making it a wonderful experience and thanks for the giggle!","stars":5}
{"text":"Hate this location and will go out of my way to avoid it. I've given this location three chances and I'm over it. Items and services overpriced compared to other locations, employee knowledge is not strong and they did not even know what Media Mail was. The last straw was bringing in an Amazon package return that they lost/misplaced and was never scanned in from this location to Amazon. Amazon thankfully credited me anyway. Avoid.","stars":1}
{"text":"Every time I come in here I get exactly the help that I need very quickly. Even when it's busy I am never waiting very long.","stars":5}
{"text":"We have been ups box customers for at least 5 or 6 years. There have been mistakes over the years of which we have tried to be understanding  ie wrong mail put in our box mostly. It did make me concerned which if any of our mail went to another box and was not returned by that box recipient. Things have gotten progressively worse over the last year or so. We have been full time traveling in our motorhome and depend on efficient forwarding of our mail. One time it was lost for 3 months and finally returned to the store. Numerous times we received mail not belonging to us which I returned. Even package slips that must have set  in our box weeks before I had the mail forwarded. I returned those. I asked if they would consider reimbursing for postage at least. Never heard from them. Next time I happen to talk to them I was told it is not the policy to refund. That was it no \"thanks for sending'' or \"sorry for your trouble\". I sure felt sorry for the customer who was suppose to receive the packages. THE FINAL BLOW was last week when ordering my mail forwarded, I had  them repeat the address to me then sending it NOT as requested & much hassle tracking it down after not receiving it in a week when it was suppose to be two days. When I called to insure it was sent to the correct address, before going seeing where it REALLY went they repeated the correct address as I gave them. . It was NOT sent that way. That's it. We are done. If you care about your mail, go somewhere else I'm sorry to say.","stars":1}
{"text":"I recently shipped a laptop out I sold on eBay at this location. I am young, an 8th grader, and unfamiliar with shipping products or UPS. I was helped by \"Ken\". I was not disrespectful, rude or anything remotely close to it. I admit, I was a tad bit indecisive, but nothing that merited the attitude that was brought upon me. \"Ken\" acted callous, passive aggressive, and generally annoyed towards me. When going over insurance options I asked for a 500$ policy shortly after he rung up me up for a different one. He completely snapped at me, telling me in an aggressive way not to \"make him ring it up again\". Constant eye rolls and sighs of discontent. I did not want to cause the (older) man to be fired or get in trouble, so I did not initially write a response. Until learning he was the OWNER/MANAGER OF THE STORE. Don't go here. I am not speaking on the behalf of the employee's (which they very well might be nice), but on the ground that the owner/manager is a d**k. Not to mention I saw another review about him, he acted this way towards a pregnant woman????!!! What is wrong with him. Save yourself the trouble. The guys and girls at the post office are wonderful- truly kind and compassionate people. I cannot say the same for my experience with the manager of the UPS on Kings Highway.","stars":1}
{"text":"I stop by here frequently to do amazon returns. It's always very quick and everyone has been friendly. Very convenient location.","stars":5}
{"text":"Staff are very professional. I use this often for shipping as they are reliable and our packages arrive in a timely manner.  They are more expensive than USPS but I find worth it when I want a package to arrive by a certain date.","stars":5}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews, I find that people here to be helpful. Sometimes the lines are long but that's to be expected. Last time I went I had a ton of returns and Ryan II helped me. Awesome customer service!","stars":5}
{"text":"They DO NOT have a Notary! I called ahead of time to confirm whether or not they did and the call rang through to an answering machine. 3X in 30 minutes! When I got to the store and learned that they did not have a notary they apologized but gave no explanation as to what was going on with the phone. I told them to change the info an Yelp and they said that they were not able to!","stars":1}
{"text":"Vey pleasant interaction and polite customer service. Managing the social distancing guidelines as best they can.","stars":5}
{"text":"I've always had good experiences at this UPS Store - until today. Despite a sign outside requiring masks to enter a female customer was at the counter sending a package without wearing a mask. Disappointed and will not return anytime soon.","stars":2}
{"text":"I visited this store for fax thing.   I saw one indian guy worked here does horribly different attitude to colorful people compared with white customer.  Looks like garbage!!","stars":1}
{"text":"We had some legal documents that required multiple signatures and a notary public. The notary noticed that we needed witnesses who knew us and offered to meet at our home or office for signatures. We were able to bring back witnesses with us and get the documents signed in a few minutes. This is an excellent, easy-to-use store and we were thankful for the notary's insight. Thank you, Carlos!","stars":5}

{"text":"The best service I have ever had at any UPS, FedEx, etc. Alex and Jesse were so helpful and patient. I just moved from NC 2 days ago and did not have my printer set up. I had about 4 things I needed sent to different companies, they handled everything quickly and efficiently. I'll definitely go back.","stars":5}

Please wear your masks and keep this wonderful woman safe who helped me mail these packages!","stars":5}
{"text":"I am new to the area and have been to this location 3 times. The first 2 times I went the employees were very nice and very helpful. The third time I went Jordan helped me. He didn't seem to know what he was doing. It took forever because when he scanned my documents he also included a document that belonged to someone else that was just sitting on the table. Not very professional as I wouldn't want that to happen to my documents. So he had to do it over again. When he finally finished he didn't give me my documents back and I had to ask for them. I also had to ask for a bag or an envelope to put all of the papers in. I told him that things weren't going so well with all this and he said that he had had a long day. No apologies. Not the response that I was looking for. If UPS is going to handle documents then I need to have a professional person doing it. Very disappointed and probably won't go back to this location.","stars":1}
{"text":"Do not use UPS.com to estimate your shipping cost. It told me $61.60 and when I took it to this location they charged me $83. The clerk said people say they used UPS estimator app and it's never correct. What's the point? And yes, my weights and measurements were right.","stars":2}

They called me with the total cost, accepted my credit card, and everything arrived in perfect condition, well packed and wrapped. Job well done!","stars":5}

I call UPS and they said that the store can reimburse. Called the store back and was told he couldn't do anything. I asked to speak with the Franchisee and never received a callback. This was the first and only time I will give this place my business. I'll go back to FedEx for my shipping services.","stars":1}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this store at all. There machine malfunctioned and charged me twice. Courtney, who works there, told me to keep my receipt, and if it charges twice, to come in a get a refund. So I was charged twice but the owner won't honor that.

{"text":"I visited the store today(Dec 8th,2018) at 4PM, there's an older white male employee working the front desk was extremely rude. First he ignored a customer, the customer tried to talk to him and asked him a question IN FRONT OF HIM, and he just pretended he didn't hear the customer, and he just keep counting the money in the register, I know you are busy, but at least have the decency acknowledge the customer's existence by saying \" just one sec please\", the customer was totally shocked by this so he just left the box on the floor because it is a drop off, and then this older white male employee proceeded to say with a VERY rude and annoyed tone \" Nobody told u that u can put the box there, I need to know if the package is worth more than $1000.\" The customer was so mortified by his rude tone and the question. I really wanted to say something because if it wasn't because the older white male employee who works there didn't bother to respond to the customer's question then this won't even happen.  I will proceed to file a complaint to the corp against this employee. I know this must be a busy season for UPS, but we are the customers, you can't treat us like that. I strongly recommend this employee to find a job at USPS because his attitude definitely fits well in there.\n\nOn the other hand, the short hair girl with glasses although was slow, but at least she is polite enough to apologize for being slow and she even said \"thank you and have a nice day\" to me! This is the perfect example of how a nice attitude can even overturn the slow service, as long as you are polite, we can take the slow service.","stars":1}
{"text":"Normally service is okay at best, but some of the employees are super rude. The bald guy with glasses should lose his job, imo.","stars":2}
{"text":"They are ready to do whatever I need, packages and documents - notary available. During COVID my Bank was not available  for this. I am grateful to the UPS Store that they could provide this service.","stars":5}
{"text":"Little on the expensive side. But fast and easy and helped with everything I needed. Very satisfied. I saw other bad rating on Yelp and had to write a review because my service here was pretty great.","stars":5}
{"text":"Great UPS store! I'm surprised by the other less positive reviews, actually. I will say, I've only used this location to return pre-paid items... but they are fantastic about it. The guys are always very friendly, the process is always super quick and they're very Covid-conscious... only one person is allowed in the lobby at a time. I will definitely keep coming back as long as I have to return things, which means I will keep coming back forever. Btw, it's always easy to get a parking space in front, too.","stars":5}
{"text":"Very disappointed that I had to pay five dollars for them to tape up a box that had a postage pre-paid return. I understand the tape is not free but five dollars?? I feel like a fool for leaving my package there and actually paying the money.  I won't be back.","stars":2}

{"text":"Each time I have been here (after 3PM during the week), they have only had 1 person working there. You can see a line almost out the door each time. I was behind a guy getting something notarized so that took forever. It should be an in and out experience here but it isn't. Workers aren't particularly friendly either.","stars":1}

{"text":"Brought 2 garbage bags full of paper to shred to this store.  Paid for one of the bags and while Ryan is handing me the receipt he tells me their shred policy is for me to leave my bag of sensitive information there at the store for all the employees to have access to until the next day when their shred vendor gets there.  Then he's going to give my bag of sensitive information to the vendor to put in the shred bin.  It's 12:46pm.  That means every employee from now until tomorrow, along with the vendor can just rummage through my sensitive information.  So, I tell Ryan I would like to place the items in the shred bin myself.  Another employee, Marvin, tells Ryan no one is allowed to be in the store when I do it, and they told me to wait.  So I patiently wait for everyone to leave, and go to start putting my stuff in the bin and they tell me I can only do it after the store closes.  They won't let me do it.  So, I asked to speak to a manager and got George, whom confirmed I'm not allowed to do it myself and not during store hours, that my sensitive information has to sit there over night and wait for the vendor to do it the next day.  Mind you, anyone that works with HIPAA has seen the shred bins.  They have an extremely tiny slot in them that no one can see into.  I posted a pic.  George tells me this is store policy.  I told him what it says online and he just said this is our store policy, sorry.  Here's what UPS website says about their shred services:. \"When you visit, we'll weigh your documents and then you'll place them into the secured, locked shredding bin. It's that easy.\"  No, at this UPS location it's not that easy.  As an employee that works in the healthcare industry and deals with HIPAA on a daily basis, this is the opposite of how you handle sensitive information.  I will be filing additional complaints as the other poor unsuspecting customers have no idea of the exposure of just leaving their sensitive information there for all to see and be passed around until it finally makes its way into the bin.  This is egregious.  Do better UPS.","stars":1}
{"text":"Avoid this store at all costs!  Would give zero stars, if possible.  Greedy and rude employees. Ricardo insisted on charging me $3 + copies to use the open customer computer for less than one minute to print off a shipping label. Absolutely ridiculous. There is zero reason to charge someone to use a computer that is already paid for and turned on. Zero. I have used dozens of UPS stores across the entire country and NEVER been charged to use the computer to print a shipping label. UPS is already being paid to ship the parcel! Stop nickel and diming your customers! Greed is the sole reason for this... And then the employee (Ricardo) had the nerve to get an attitude with me when I was shocked by this pricing.","stars":1}

Today I couldn't get out of my house and I called them and send them something to print for me and then send it to a recipient, and they did so, quickly, and just told me to pay for it next time I come in. I do have an account here and a mail box, which I highly recommend. But I also see them giving this same, kind and efficient service to everyone who comes in the door. I feel like this store is part of my working team, and that it's a great team.","stars":5}
{"text":"I would give less stars if I could.  I usually come to this store to ship my Amazon returns.  But never again!  Today I've had the \"pleasure\" of meeting the owner.  He grabbed the item form my hands while asking \"Are you going to ship it like this?\"  I responded that I am following Amazon's directions which are to bring the item in manufacturer's packaging as well as the shipping label so the store would pack it and ship it, no charge.  I have done this multiple times before and followed same procedure.  He proceeded to roughly handle the item (sensitive electronics) while saying under his breath: \"God forbid something happens to it, you will regret it later\".  I replied: \"If you think it is unsafe to ship it like this, please package it properly\".  His response was: \"Boxes cost money!\" I told him I've shipped multiple items to Amazon from this store and  was never asked to pay extra.  His response was: \"Not for your item!\".  When I asked for a manager, he told me he is the owner and shouted at me to get out.  He then proceeded to taking my package (which, again, contained sensitive electronics) and throwing it out on the pavement right outside of the store.  He was very agitated and I thought it would be better to leave immediately.  I called Amazon customer service right away, and they confirmed that I followed their instruction exactly.  I am reporting this incident to the UPS corporate office. Given abundance of UPS stores in the area, would suggest customers to choose one  where management understands what customer service is.","stars":1}

{"text":"This UPS Store in Cherry Hill on Haddonfield Rd is a pleasure in every way. The owner,  Jatin Patel,  provided us with above and beyond customer service (and has the patience of a Saint). Due to poor planning on my part we were shipping  Mom's birthday gift to the Palisades, CA with 2 days to go and were unable to afford the over $150 cost  (note: via UPS or USPS) to get it there on time. I called several times for rates & clarification and Jatin helped us by explaining options between envelope or box packaging - with his assistance we were able to afford to get mom's gift to her ( not in two days but at least this week) . Also, this location is tidy and air conditioned (the closest USPS to me, Merchantville*is not!). Our visit to that USPS* store was a nightmare, after waiting over 20 minutes in 90 degree heat while the sole person behind the counter literally handled ONE, single transaction. When our turn finally came, we tried to communicate our plight- we sadly found that she was uninterested, unintelligible and of zero strategic help ( I don't know how well I'd do if I had to work solo in 90 degree heat either)...\nNote to self:\n1) For future gifting by mail, get your package together with a little time to spare!\n2)  Simply go to the UPS Cherry Hill store and ask for Jatin!\nBYW: I just found out they also offer a notary up until 3:30pm","stars":5}

{"text":"I am afraid that I must inform everyone of the difficulty that I have had at The UPS store # 949, at 561 Keystone Ave in Reno, Nevada.  I shipped a package from that store, I believe in March, 2020 to Savanna, GA and It became lost.  I called the store after a few weeks and they said that they would put a claim in.\n\nI have heard nothing from UPS until today when I called store # 949 and the person there told me to call Corporate at 800-877-1760 or Customer Relations at 800-742-5877.  None of these worked so they told me to call 800-789-4623.  I spoke to a nice woman at this number who parched me through to Store # 949.\n\nI was informed by the person at Store # 949 that since it was so late that there was no longer a tracking number.  Basically I was told by the store that it was tough and there was nothing that they could do.  They said that they were a franchise and had nothing to do with UPS.\n\nI am sure that I had insurance on my package that was lost.  I am pretty sure that the UPS corporation has some say in how these franchise stores are run.  I would like a resolution on what happened to my package and if the insurance would ever be valid.  I would also like to know why this franchise treats their customers so poorly.\n\nActually US Post Office prices are about the same as UPS now.  I think The UPS Keystone store can do better.","stars":2}

{"text":"So I must share this story of how not only RUDE the Zumbehl location of The UPS store is but to it's customers too. See let me just first say we have had a box at that location for many years, pay over $300.00 just to receive our mail there for our business!  Never had I been treated so rudely as I was by the new management/owners!  And I will say we have seen our fair share of owners here!  It's like a revolving door ‍ A few weeks ago I went in to check our box and saw we had a ticket/tag in there signifying we had a package!  Mind you there was a line outside the door so I waited over to the side until I was able to see if they would get my package for me.  This chick looked at me and said \"Are you next in line?\" I said \"No I just need my package that was delivered here!\"  Let me just say when you are a box holder you AREN'T just another \"Customer\"!!!  So she snarkily replied \"Well you have to go to the end of the line!\" I said \"I don't need you to ship anything for me I only need it given to me, takes you 2 seconds!\" She said \"Doesn't matter you have to wait in line like everyone else!\" I plainly told her \"Um NO I will not and by Jan 1 we will be closing our service here!\"  \n\nFast forward to this week....I had a package to drop off and the line was out the door. Some lady and guy looked at me as I was approaching the door \"You can't go in you have to wait outside and in line like the rest of us!\" I looked at them and said \"Oh really? Watch me!!!\" I opened said door, dropped my package and went right to my box! And yes that rude worker was there and just looked up as I passed by. I checked my mail and said \"Wait in line....I think not!\"  As I passed the nosy Ken and Karen I said \"And that's how it's done!  Have a Merry Christmas....Oh and yeah 1 more thing....Mind your own damn business!\" \n\nOn a side note....We went right to the UPS location in Wentzville and opened a box. There isn't a wait to get your package for box holders there as it should be!  My hubby called it the VIP club","stars":1}

{"text":"On January 30th I came in here to mail W2 & W3's out to the SSA for my company, USPS Priority,  so I can have a tracking number and to make sure it was stamped with January 30th date.  The older woman (Osa?) handled everything.  I look at my receipt and check the tracking number today.  Not found.  I drive over there and spoke with Mike the owner.  He said he would get back to me later in the day.  Six hours later I hear from him, and he has stated there was a \"glitch\" on USPS website and there is no tracking number.  I asked if I would have a tracking number after the \"glitch\" was resolved, in which he said no.  I will have nothing and never know if this gets lost or delivered. Awesome.  I hope Mike is prepared to pay for any fines I may get, from the SSA if that envelope does not arrive or gets lost. I just called my friend who works for USPS..there was no \"glitch\" in their system January 30th.  The only \"glitch\" is this incompetent business who clearly has no idea how to operate or comprehends what they are doing.  I am not the only one on here with this rating. I will never use this place again, and I plan on letting every colleague and anyone I know about this horrible situation.","stars":1}

{"text":"I will not go back to this store.  The employees were great.  They were friendly and helpful.  None of the problem is on them.  \nI emailed a PDF file of a return label to the UPS stores email address so that I could take the package over, have them print up the label and send it off.  I've done this several times before over several years, just not at this UPS location.  Every time in the past, the employee gets on their work computer, accesses their email account and sends the file to the printer.  I'm charged the fee for printing up the label which is under $0.50 every time.  Not at this franchisees location.  This franchisee has decided to charge his customer for his employee to use the store computer, access his stores email account and send that file to the printer, $2.50.  I think the most infuriating part of that is calling it a minimum charge for computer use.  They have computers that customers can use and they charge by the amount of time that they're used for, $2.50 minimum.  I didn't use the computer.  I didn't have any reason to.  I didn't need to get access to my own email account and print something out from it.  Since the franchisee has responded to this issue in past comments I don't expect the policy to change, but, isn't it a shame that those few dollars that I spent there today will be the last cent that person ever gets from me?  I mean whatever may come up, when it's time for me to move and I need packing supplies, boxes and such, I'll intentionally not go there.  Enjoy the $2.50, buy yourself a beer on me, I guess.","stars":1}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst UPS store that I have ever been to.  Not only is the staff extremely slow and rude, but just last Thursday I dropped off a HP laptop computer to have packaged and sent off via USPS with a prepaid shipping label that I had sold to a customer of mine online and my package was not sent out on Thursday, not sent out on Friday, not sent out on Saturday and when my customer began contacting me on Monday morning questioning when I would be shipping out as there was no tracking information, I immediately called the store only to be told in a rude manner that my shipment did in fact go out and to contact the post office.  I then contacted our local post office and spoke with a supervisor and found out that my shipment did in fact not go out and was never scanned in by USPS and was probably still sitting at this UPS Store.  I then contacted UPS customer service headquarters and filed a complaint as well as the BBB and not 2 hours later, tracking information was suddenly being updated.  I then received a phone call from the owner of the store who stated very clearly to me that USPS refused to pick up from their location because their trucks were full and I told him this was a blatant lie. So, all in all, my shipment was held from Thurs. thru Mon. and I received a bad rating as a seller.  This place is a complete joke and should be shut down due to their incompetence!!!  Btw, they also charged me for packing materials without even packing and closing my item in front of me!  It was simply put on the back counter as I finished paying. My suggestion is for everyone to head down to the UPS Store in Sparks on Baring Blvd. where the employees are pleasant and knowledgeable.","stars":1}

How oblivious was I that I didn't even know this was here?\n\nVery convenient and busy during the peak hours but it moves along quite nicely. Max wait maybe 15-20 minutes. I mean that is pretty long estimate. But we went to drop something off and it was probably a 10 minute wait because there where a few people ahead of the line. But for the most part it is a very convenient location and would recommend this place for anyone trying to ship something off in a hurry. Then you can go right over to Human Bean to grab a cup of joe haha. They are also pretty good at this location. \n\nParking is interesting. It is a smaller shopping complex and you could have a bit of an issue but for the most part there is usually more than enough parking spots for you. Sometimes they have a dance event that they do at the dance studio and they can take up a lot of the parking spaces but this doesn't happen to often. Anyways, I diverge.

However, three months later, I am still out an additional 75$, and have had the WORST customer service experience, both with Scott, and the customer care agents at UPS ( all five of the different numbers they made me call ). Everyone kept passing me to someone else and no one was giving me a straight answer. I tried to handle this patiently ( waited for three weeks while manager was on vacation, sent polite emails that never got responded to), and ended up having to throw a fit over the phone to finally get someone's supervisor to answer on why I am not getting my money ( that's right, the packed it, shipped, it broke it, I'm still paying for it) .

{"text":"So I've been using this location to sell items and I use it as my main delivery platform. I was starting to get concerned when I noticed my price being shipped to the exact same location started to go up for no reason. I bought a scale and went to the UPS site where I then started to weigh my own packages and input the dimensions along with the location of where the package is going. My most recent package after experimenting, came out to $12.09. But when I got to the store I was told because the time I came in it was going to be $17.86. The two young man at the front desk were little to no help in explaining why this price went up five dollars for no apparent reason. I have tested this theory again and every time it shows true. I went to a different UPS store and there the price actually matched from what I put in at ups.com for the price analyzer. I will be making note of this and reporting it to the Better Business Bureau after I contact UPS as all of the stores are franchise. Clearly the owner of this store has a different agenda. I have attached photos as well. Take your business elsewhere or to a more reputable UPS store that will not gouge you an additional five dollars because you came in four hours past the time you calculated your price. My receipt says that the five dollars was for service options, none of which I asked for. I stated multiple times I wanted nothing but the ground service. They've lost my business. Even after I offered to come back in tomorrow to get the $12 rate, the young man who was very unprofessional I might add, shrugged his shoulders and said it is what it is.","stars":1}

Keep in mind that I had just mailed these identical envelopes 3 days earlier , same location - no problem for $2 a piece. The owner and middle aged lady gave my husband hard time over the envelopes. Eventually after weighing every single identical item envelope, they charged him $2.72 per envelope. Price is not the point , just the horrible way the my treat customers.  I will drive to Franklin store from now on. Had enough","stars":1}

Thus, my package not only didn't go out until Monday late, but it also didn't even have a valid tracking number for over 50 hours, a real disappointment.  This is a problem with UPS in general. Their tracking numbers ought to show as pending instead of invalid if they're not going to receive status updates for two plus consecutive days.","stars":2}
{"text":"I was excited to see a UPS store open not far from our home, especially since I had an important package to ship last week. And, I was able to do so, albeit with trepidation. (Keep reading.)\n\n4 clerks in this store during my visit - 3 standing behind the counter, one sitting in a chair alongside watching and providing advice (?). Most obvious thing upon entering -- absolutely no one in the store was wearing a mask or gloves. And of the four other customers, only one  person besides myself was wearing a mask.\n\nOne young man (apparently a trainee since he had to ask for assistance from other clerks throughout my process of mailing a normal padded envelope) did his best to help...but it took quite a while to complete my transaction. (And I was not excited about tarrying...but I did not criticize or complain.)\n\nWhat I don't understand is, \"Why - in a small public facility with untold numbers of people entering and exiting all day long, handling packages from who-knows-where, were no safety precautions in place?\"\n\nNo hint of anything out of the ordinary in this time of Covid-19.\n\nYes, there was a large bottle of hand sanitizer on the desk. But this disease is transmitted through sneezes, coughs, and other respiratory functions...and at times via direct contact.\n\nAnd yes, I know there is a range of information, guidelines, and regulations regarding safe distance, to mask or not to wear a mask.No stringent regulations in this part of Tennessee. Nevertheless, these folks are rolling the dice in terms of public safety. And that is not going to earn them many stars.\n\nUpdate today (6 days later)...had another package to send....no change in masks or other \"suggested\" safety measures at this location when I looked in...so I took my business to a UPS store 4 miles away where all clerks were wear masks & gloves and there were clear guidelines marked for customers' (& staff's) safety.","stars":1}

I have been going to this UPS store for several years and they have yet to leave me disappointed. Fortunately, enough for me there was a worker named Candy who was amazing. She literally came from around the counter to assist me. Not only did she come to assist she also ask another coworker which happen to be another young lady to grab a tool from the back to help remove a wheel that was protruding out making it difficult to seal the box. The package was a stroller that was being return to Amazon because of missing part but that's besides the point. Candy was pleasant and helpful.

In the meantime, I was not greeted and a word was never spoken to me until 5 minutes later when the associate who was assisting another customer asked another associate who was sitting at a computer to assist me. He got up to assist me and I explained to him that I wanted to print 10 copies of my resume on paper that I brought from home specifically for my resumes. I asked him if I should email it to him and he said yes. I emailed the document over to him and he printed one copy as a test on the resume paper I provided. The copy came out incorrectly because the paper was bent or something went wrong with the copier. He double checked the other sheets and printed another sheet. The print was successful and he printed the rest. I was left with 9 copies instead of 10 because the first one printed incorrectly and I did not want it printed on regular paper. When we got up to the register the total was $5.29. I asked him how that was possible since I brought my own paper and I only received 9 prints. He stated he only charged for the 9 and the other charge was for computer use. He never disclosed to me prior to me emailing the documents over to him from my iPhone that I would incur an additional charge. I don't quite understand how me emailing a document over to him is deemed as computer use since I did it from my phone but nonetheless, I was charged without knowing that would be the case since it was not disclosed to me prior. I expressed that frustration to him and he said nothing to me in response. The customer service there was extremely poor and I am very disappointed. The associate's name was James who assisted me. Full disclosure is everything and as other reviewers have said about this place, it's a ripoff. Don't go here, stick with Office Depot.

When I called to make sure this was really true - the woman who answered the phone was exasperated and did not confirm it. I figured I would go in; sometimes face to face is easier. Well, maybe I caught this store on an off afternoon but it was a little bit nuts in there. A guy was helping some people who did some convoluted stuff and were calling their UPS guy lazy and dropping F bombs. That left me with the woman I spoke to on the phone. She was really gruff and impatient - it was clear she did not want to deal with me. Also the phone rang and she couldn't find it and was kinda rude to the person on the phone and then put the person on hold while she helped me - which took a while. I would attribute this mostly to her inability to scan the QR codes. It might be the scan gun's fault, or she needs training, I don't know.

Days later my tv arrives to Las Vegas completely shattered and unusable. I have contacted this store and corporate immediately. The owner of this store has avoided me and given me the run around for months. This is a horribly operated UPS. The owner of this place does not care about the customers, the packages, or even educating employees. I have no received compensation despite having paid insurance. I can't even solidify compensation from corporate because of this owner's lack of correspondence and negiligence with this situation. I have only asked for the money spent on the package back and not received it. I have already lost a valuable $300-$400 television and you refuse to even compensate the HORRIBLE packing and shipping. The package didn't even say FRAGILE! Never go to this UPS store. The owner does not care about you or your mail","stars":1}

It is not that big and easy to find what you are looking for. The staff is friendly, polite, and professional. Easy to talk to and if you have specific questions they have been able to answer all of mine. Some were not so easy. \n\nThere is not much more I can say except that I do highly recommend this UPS store location. The ownership recently changed. I haven't been able to notice any significant change from the previous owner, Paul.\n\nIt is located in the corner of the shopping center next to the Sav Mart grocery store. Parking is a bit difficult when the shopping center is crowded. Watch out! You don't want to get in a parking lot accident!","stars":5}

I send and receive 100 plus packages a week and never was charged at any other UPS store.

{"text":"Usually I get excellent customer service from this store but today I called in asking what time would the cutoff be to send a Christmas package to California and Eric answered the phone. He seemed to be on a hurry and asked me a question but when I didn't answer to his liking he was a bit rude and asked me to hold. So I held for a couple minutes and then hung up and called two other locations trying to get an answer. Both calls went to voicemail and their boxes were full so I called UPS Wilmot location back and Eric answered again. This time he seemed more short with me and basically interrupted me every time I tried to speak and when I asked him why he was doing that he hung up on me. This is too bad, that one person can ruin a really good experience for a whole store. I won't be going back I will find another location where I'm treated with respect. \nI'm super disappointed.","stars":1}

Young and very unfriendly woman looked at my shoe box and barked \"You have to repack that or UPS is not going to pay you if the box gets damaged.\" My response was that if the box gets damaged, I will not be using UP anymore. She had me fill in the address slip and then stated that the cheapest shipping is $27.48.\" Excuse me? I asked about their service to have it shipped USPS. $67.83.\" Excuse me? I declined and left. I went to Fedex and had the box shipped for $10.12.\" and a much better attitude. \nThis UPs is off my list of place I would ever ship anything from again. What a horrible experience.","stars":1}

Wow.  So I shipped a package express, and the person who helped me helpfully corrected the address because the system said it should be \"Loop\" instead of \"Street\".  Unfortunately, it should have been \"Street\" instead of \"Loop\".  So the package was supposed to be delivered yesterday, but was not, and since the person who helped me failed to put my phone number on the package (even though they asked for my phone number...) I was not informed of the failed delivery.  I needed these documents back in my hands today, but instead I'll be getting them tomorrow AT BEST, and it's entirely due to screwups by the inattentive staff here.\n\nRude I can deal with, but add rude and error-prone together and you earn yourself a review.","stars":1}

They incorrectly labeled my package and my $800 watch STILL has not been delivered.  When I spoke with the manager he did not accept fault and could of cared less.  I paid extra for delivery and had zero service.  I did insure my package.  The UPS stores off of Mid Rivers and HWY K are much more knowledgeable and both were on par with the streamline policy and procedures that UPS regulates by.  Maybe the Zumbehl location needs to reread them.  As an FYI my package was from STL to DC.  I have waited an entire day dealing with this.","stars":1}

He kept pushing me to use my info just incase I was sending \"drugs\" or \"dangerous objects.\" I was sending out shirts... He informed me that I could not use the company's ups account after I kept mentioning that I was tying to use the business information. I would have paid for the service then been reimbursed but decided to leave. \n\nBeing rude with a grin on on your face is all the same. Just plain rude.

We called this store who set the package aside. When I went to pick it up they refused to give me my refund. No services were rendered.  I agreed to pay them their local cut if the shipping so they were not out any money. They refused and stated they get to keep all of it even though it did not ship. After a while they said they would refund but I had only my card, not my wife's. Same credit card account and they refused to refund it. It is well known they could have issued the credit without the actual card. I had all the receipts. While I was there another customer stated to me that they tried to rip her off also a few days ago. She was there for Amazon drop off, not as a paying customer. These are not good people and do not deserve your hard earned money.\n\nThe owner responded with a weak attempt to make themselves look good. They are a rude arrogant incompetent bunch.

While I later found out this location does not accept UPS accounts, she was nice to share I can go to another location, where they accept UPS accounts.  I asked her for the address, and she while still sitting, gave me blank stare and proceeded to ask me \"does your phone have google\"?  Very smartass-like.

I asked if he could print it out since neither of the other options were available/not working. He seemed irritated and as if having him print out two pieces of paper was something that was an extremely difficult and time-consuming​ thing to do. I was the only other customer in the store so there really shouldn't have been a problem. He said that they're trying to not do that anymore and suggest to customers to use the self-service computer. Well, there's only one in the store so what was I left to do. He printed it out and I left but the attitude I received​ was not the best. So two suggestions, get at least two computers at this location and make sure the staff has a smile on their face and not make the customers feel as if they are a burden to deal with​.","stars":2}

{"text":"I would give these 2 stores a negative 5 stars if it would let me... Let me tell you what happened to me.. the owner of this store and the other Bellevue store could give a crap about shipping anything you have that is of value. I shipped 2 hand made end tables worth $1600 ea. I went to the hwy 100 location and asked if I should pack it my self, Lakendra said no problem, for $136 we can pack it and you'll be protected, if anything happens you'll get your money back right away... I was nervous and said I can help pack I live 3 min away, she said no problem we got this.. I decided to get $3600 worth of insurance for both tables. Tables were made with wood from an 1800's barn, hand poured and stained concrete tops and metal strapping.  Well the tables got to my client in Florida completely destroyed! The claims dept. said they needed to come pick up the tables and packing, I said I can't get that wood go anywhere please I can repair them, they said no problem take pictures and we will file your claim.. well fast forward 8 months later and they have denied my claim, for both tables... I flew down to Florida, made new concrete tops, repaired the tables. Ups won't honor even a repair claim, stating that there was confusion in whether I repaired them or not.. so they charged me full price, took my insurance money, packed my tables like 2 year olds, took that money, destroyed my tables, and told me to take a hike... screw these two stores.. they could give a shit about your parcels.. the owner only cares about his own profits.. that asshole, and even the regional ass hole won't call me with an explanation.. they leave it to the girls in the store who know nothing... I wish I could get my hands on the owner and the regional guy... stay far away from these two stores... !!!!\n\n\n10/12/17\nOk Brittany, thanks for responding I guess. Don't know how sincere you really are cause I still haven't heard from you or anyone else... and I don't know how you will push my claim through when it's been denied 2 times.. not sure you are even trying cause no one has contacted me... I don't expect a full replacement value of course, but I do expect the repairs reimbursed and the money I paid to have your inexperienced people pack them reimbursed. I have a friend who works for ups as an engineer, he said that if your people packed it it's a no brainer, I get meh money back... I told him what's happening and he can't friggin believe it. He said it has to be the franchise owners screwing me.. we will see I guess.. why in the world do you sell shipping insurance when you never intend to honor it? Is it just a way to make more money??? not holding my breath... but I'm not gonna let it go...","stars":1}

The girl at the counter explained that the notary wasn't in and she'll be back tomorrow. She apologized and I left. When I search Google and every single UPS store is glaring me in the face, it makes me inclined to think that UPS stores are Notary masters and have one at all times. This is not the case.

The (undescribed associate for privacy reasons) behind the counter hands me a box, and as I start to bubble wrap it he says \"oh don't worry about that I'll throw a couple peanuts in there and tape it up for ya\".  I'm not shocked to hear this as I ship several items a year,  just never from this place.  Some people have charged for this some don't depending on the size I've seen.  Everyone who has charged, says so up front thus far.  Anyway I asked for \"cheapest slowest\" shipping, knowing it was under 10 bucks.  When I was told the price of $17 I said \"That's a lot more for shipping than the other UPS store.\n\nNow tell me if I'm wrong here, but if I asked you \"Wow that's a lot\"  you might say, \"Well hey you got this, this and this\".  But No, the reply I got was 'Are you shipping it to California?'  (Meanwhile they entered in the info not 120 seconds earlier it was going to Tennessee)  Only after I swiped and actually had a paper receipt did I realize that my box that could ship a paperback novel cost me over 5 bucks and the kind piece of tape and few peanuts added another fee.  (Remember he was kind enough to look out for my supply of scrap bubble wrap and packing tape earlier)\n\n1st shame on me for not asking every question like asking questions of a child.  2nd shame on them for not being up front about price as he was \"DOING ME FAVORS\".  Given the two choices, I'd call the man a snake as one of his after the fact-behind the counter excuse was \"I should have asked\"  Which indirectly I did concerning the high price, so I guess that means he was withholding.  \n\nA relatively cheap lesson to learn and pass on (as I had already written the RMA number on the box prior to the great peanut offer of 2010).  \n\nMoral:  Don't be deceived by innocent looking people offering favors.","stars":1}
{"text":"I came into this location to as ship some Easter toys to Florida. The price alone was shocking as it was over 65 dollars.  I decided against spending that much money to ship toys that weren't even valued at a 1/3 of that cost.  The lady at the counter who called me \"Hun\" repeatedly couldn't refund my card.  She told me I'd have to wait for her boss Julie.  I'm on my lunch break and don't have time for Julie to arrive. She then gets her co worker to bring Angela in to help.  Angela had a horrible attitude as she stated \"I was in the middle of doing something and I'm here to fix your problem\" after I asked her why she had such and attitude.  It's incredible that people treat thier customers this way.  I would recommend saving yourself the headache and going elsewhere for your shipping needs.","stars":1}

Not only do they handle all of my outgoing and incoming mail with accuracy and efficiency but the customer service and management in the store is excellent. In the past seven years of working with fine group of people, there has been literally one error in the hundreds of letters and packages and envelopes that have come in and gone out for us. That minor problem once brought to Terry's attention was immediately corrected with profuse apologies, and systems put into place to prevent it from ever happening again. This is exactly what good management does!\nBottom line if I could give them 10 out of five stars I would.

UPS Customer Service needs to get their employees trained properly and not give out false information.  Not one UPS drop off had Labels.

I don't have a need for their service often, but for the three visits in the past 8 months they have always excelled in service.  The first visit was to send a difficult to wrap item, and they showed remarkable problem solving and reasonable pricing.  The second visit was to ship a furniture piece to Las Vegas (no, not to pay off a bet) and they actually evaluated and sent me to a competitor that had a different and cheaper method to take care of my predicament!  My last visit involved shipping business items that took a little extra care.  Again outstanding service and I highly recommend to all.","stars":5}

{"text":"I freelance for a company that has the foresight to provide me with pre-printed UPS mailing stickers. Luckily they do this, because when I came in here and did my business, I noticed a sign that said that they don't provide printers for account holders to pre-print their own mail slips before they turn in their packages.\n\nI *think* what this means is that they'll still print out the stickers for you if their staff can do all the weighing of your package. Maybe they didn't want anyone understating how much their packages weigh. This didn't apply to me, but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nCame in on a weekday before noon, and I was the only customer. Doesn't mean anything; I was just lucky? \n\nI didn't spend much time looking around. They have the usual mailing and office supplies. I did see their wall of mailboxes. Since US Mail will most likely be bankrupt soon, this might be something to consider.","stars":4}

Let me tell you what happened to me.. the owner of this store and the other Bellevue store could give a crap about shipping anything you have that is of value.

I went to the hwy 100 location and asked if I should pack it my self, Lakendra said no problem, for $136 we can pack it and you'll be protected, if anything happens you'll get your money back right away... I was nervous and said I can help pack I live 3 min away, she said no problem we got this.. I decided to get $3600 worth of insurance for both tables. Tables were made with wood from an 1800's barn, hand poured and stained concrete tops and metal strapping.  Well the tables got to my client in Florida completely destroyed! The claims dept. said they needed to come pick up the tables and packing, I said I can't get that wood go anywhere please I can repair them, they said no problem take pictures and we will file your claim.. well fast forward 8 months later and they have denied my claim, for both tables... I flew down to Florida, made new concrete tops, repaired the tables. Ups won't honor even a repair claim, stating that there was confusion in whether I repaired them or not.. so they charged me full price, took my insurance money, packed my tables like 2 year olds, took that money, destroyed my tables, and told me to take a hike... screw these two stores.. they could give a shit about your parcels.. the owner only cares about his own profits.. that asshole, and even the regional ass hole won't call me with an explanation.. they leave it to the girls in the store who know nothing...

I needed to send a letter sent overnight, so I asked what they charged, was it competitive with USPS?  The young man stated that\"USPS doesn't guarantee over night delivery\", I was taken by surprise with this comment, they wanted 45.00.

{"text":"Here's the deal -- there are a whole lot of places you can go to ship something out -- USPS, FedEX, UPS.  and there are several UPS stores in the area, some closer to me than this one.\n\nso why will I always go to this location?  Some of the finest customer service every witnessed.  This evening, a young man by the name of Bill waited on me;  amazing young man.  No, my task wasn't anything complicated...but he made the experience so wonderful that I know I will always come here.\n\nHey, franchise owner -- give this guy a raise.  He's hard working, extremely professional, and a credit to your shop.  Just do it.","stars":5}
{"text":"Walked in to the business wanting to ship 2 packages. 1 was a pre-paid and the other needed to be weighed and labeled. The woman working there had long black hair and long nails. She was arguing with a man that was trying to the copy machine. She would walk over to the counter to help me, yell at the man, then tell me I would have to wait and walk over and help the guy at the copier. This went on for 3 to 4 times. I said, just help him, he was here before me. Plus I was tired of her yelling right in to my face but at him. I had a bad feeling about this place. I should have just left and went to another store. Then she helps me and she has the same crappy attitude she did with the guy at the copier. I knew I should have just walked out when I had the chance. Over all, was only there for a few minutes, but they were a painfully long and weird few minutes. Next time I need packages mailed, or copies made, or anything else I would normally go to that store for, I will drive a couple more miles and take my chance at another store. It will be worth and it can't be any worse. This woman obviously didn't want to be there and had no trouble letting all in the store know. Never said \"Hi\", \"Good morning\", \"thank you\"... nothing. Won't go back.","stars":1}

I was out of town and foolishly went to a competing entities' store down the street a little because I had some art to ship and, get this, the only box they had was enormous and heavy.

I needed help figuring out how to print from the internet, but an employee named Teri was helpful in getting me started. As I was working on getting everything I needed downloaded and printed, we chatted a bit and she really lightened my mood! \n\nThe store was clean - otherwise I can't say much about it except that their computer was a bit slow. Taking off one star for that, but customer service was A+.","stars":4}

I popped into the store near closing time to see if they could print my borderless resume for a job interview I had the next morning. The resume design included color printing all the way to the edge of the paper, which (I didn't realize) meant it needed to be printed on a larger paper size and then cut down to the standard size. Steve was amazing and stayed late to get the job done for me. He followed up with a personal email that same night, letting me know the job was done. I picked up the resumes the next morning on the way to the interview -- they looked amazing.\n\nSince then I've been in the store several times for various printing / shipping tasks. Steve or any of the staff have been been great each time. \n\nI really appreciate the customer service I have received.","stars":5}

They accept online returns, sell packing and office supplies, have a variety of cards, design your business graphics, etc. The thing that's impressive is how competent  and efficient they are, just calm and professional, whether they are serving just one customer or have a line to the door. These places often don't  have the sharpest people working, but every one of their employees is top-notch, friend fly, and professional","stars":5}
{"text":"Lousy miserable bully older men. The younger man tried to help but in the end not one of them had any problem solving skills. I was trying to return 2 boxes but the merchant only provided 1 shipping label for the total weight. I tried to get another label from the merchant but they refused. I went and asked if UPS had one large box to put them both in they didn't then I said can't you just split labels and divide the weight. Two different men came over to yell at me that they can't do anything and to go back to amazon. I left disgusted as the 2 boxes have 500.00 worth of merchandise I needed. Thank god I am resourceful I shrink wrapped the two boxes together and wrapped in brown postal paper and sent them back. Morons in the UPS store who supposedly know what they are doing didn't think of anything. Go there if you want to be abused and treated like garbage. If I could put zero stars I would.","stars":1}
{"text":"I came here with my son to get a mailbox. We were helped by Terry and I was immediately impressed! She directed all of the information towards my son, knowing he would be the person responsible for the mailbox. She was warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and made sure all of his questions were answered. The price was reasonable as he and his roommates are sharing the cost. It gives me peace of mind that any packages I send will be safe from thieves!  The location is wonderful since it is close to the campus. Terry is definitely an asset to The UPS Store.","stars":5}
{"text":"Won't ever go back to this location. The first time I went there, they wanted to CHARGE me a DOLLAR to use some of their tape... I think not. Other locations don't do that. Also, I just went there to drop off a package at exactly 6:53pm (they close at 7), the gate inside was half way open with a customer and the employee at the counter, AND the door was locked. I've worked in retail for eight years and if a customer comes in at 6:59pm when her close at 7 we would still have to let them in. Such poor customee service here.","stars":1}

She lied and said that they don't take UPS Ground if you have a pre-printed shipping label and said that if I want to mail out of there I have to buy UPS Overnight from her or I have to buy a box.  Basically, they want you to buy something and they don't just take UPS drop offs if they can help it.  I needed a UPS box which UPS usually provides for you for free.  But she wasn't willing to do that for me.  Also, she touched my merchandise and started looking at it while I was holding it in my arms.  I told her I don't need her help packing I just need a box.  I had a preprinted UPS label from Amazon.\n\nAnyway, I have used other UPS stores and Postnets in the Tampa Bay area and they were always friendly.  I would sometimes do drop offs and no one gave me any problems.  Other times I would buy something.  But I can assure you, I will never go back to this hole in the wall again.","stars":1}

I entered the store to two men behind the counter. I was the only customer there. Repeat, I was the ONLY customer there. I was told that I needed to make an appointment to get the prints done. Keep in mind that it takes less than 5 minutes to do this. They simply have to punch in a reference number that I give them and then take electronic prints. These guys said that they could not help me because a customer was coming in in a few minutes. I asked if there was anyway that they could do me this favor since I was the only person in the store and they refused.  These guys were behind the counter doing NOTHING. They went out of their way NOT to help  me. Pathetic. I won't be using this business again.","stars":1}

It looked like a flier you put on a telephone pole for your missing cat, not a professional photo. Staples was also a nightmare.\n\n Went here they have a big photo printer, and employee Jason did it all for me. Comparable to the professional photo places I go to when i'm in NY.","stars":5}

I order a lot online and maybe return 20 percent  that was not as described or was not what I needed , had missing parts etc.  I just print out my return label and drop off. They will print the label for you if you dont have a printer if it is an Amazon order.  But they are always prompt and very helpful and friendly.  The person that complained about a $3.00 charge for having his printing done as he said \"many time without that charge'  should maybe just buy a printer and not criticize a company for charging for their services.  The deal they have with Amazon is a contracted deal with a major shipper and no one should expect free services unless  they are paid for by the company you deal with.","stars":5}

Well I brought the box into the front and handed it to the kid working there with the blonde hair. There was a line of people waiting and I did not have time to wait for him to accept it and give me a receipt i barely had time to stop as it was, but I assumed that was okay. Boy was I wrong. by the next morning I never received the confirmation that my package was delivered (overnight priority). It actually hadn't even been scanned as received. I go back and talk to the guy, he said maybe the driver didn't scan it to wait, and to call the 800 number. \n\nI called the 800 number and they had no knowledge of the package because it was never received by ups. \n\nLong story short, my package was never shipped because someone at this location decided that they wanted it more. The package was quite valuable and I did pay for insurance but since the package was never scanned into the system so I am not covered. I am out complete of $3000 and the employees of this store were of absolutely so help and said they gave it to the driver when he did his daily pick up.\n\nI happen to personally know the driver for this route and know for fact he is quite good at doing his job and I know for fact he would've scanned it if the package has indeed been given to him. \n\nMy advice to anyone needing to use UPS, go online and print the label yourself, it will be a lot cheaper anyways and then call and have a driver come to you and pick it up. You cant tell me that of the thousands of packages I send out every year, that the only one I didn't get a receipt for got lost? I highly doubt that. I wouldn't ship anything through this store, I wouldn't get a mailbox here or anything as it is not safe.\n\nIf you HAVE TO drop off here, BE SURE TO GET A RECEIPT YOU MAY NEVER SEE OR HEAR ABOUT THAT PACKAGE AGAIN","stars":1}

I'm usually in and out in 5-10 minutes! \n\nWhat I love about UPS in general is that I can come with items and address in hands and just throw it at them...after paying of course. They make it so easy on me to mail things that it helps me with my procrastination problems...kind of...a little bit. The package is a 2 month old gift but it could be worse! \n\nThank you for making my busy life easier!","stars":5}

Didn't greet me and asked me \"what do you want\"?  Like seriously?  Who the heck in their right mind would come to this store.  I called UPS Store customer care and made a complaint immediately.  The best part was that she told me if I don't like her service to go to Pack and Ship down the street.  And that is exactly what I did.  Shame on the UPS store owner (who I was told owns several locations) for not addressing this issue.  These stores are his bread and butter and with disgruntled employees like Bonnie he will be left with just butter no bread.  Not even breadcrumbs.  Shame on this franchisee.","stars":1}

{"text":"Don't bother with this place, since they nickle and dime you and the staff member who served me clearly thought a customer coming in during business hours was a huge inconvenience. I needed to print an Amtrak ticket and came into the store at 7:45 (it closes at 8:00). I ask to use their printer, and the front desk guy tells me right away \"no can do\" because the circa-2004 desktop computer had been shut down already and he \"always\" turns it off right before the store closes (or in my case 15 minutes before). I counter that the store is still open! He begrudging started the computer up (took a whopping 30 seconds to turn on), I print the ticket from my email, and then go to pay (spent maybe 2 minutes on the computer total). Front desk guy disappeared to the back at that point and came out like 5 minutes later (could you have made it any more obvious you thought having a customer was a big pain in the a** for you?). \n\nThe total came out to be $5.00, for two printed pages! Other UPS stores I had used printing services for charged per page, and I would end up spending, at most, $0.50-$1.00. I was told I wasn't being charged for the paper or ink but for the use of the computer. Huh? I had coupon for X% off a print job, and I'm told the coupon doesn't apply to the service I just used. I asked \"Did I not just print something out?\" and he explained that it applied for business printing (nowhere did the coupon say that). I was just fed up so I left but I do know I'll never go back there. PostNet down the street, Staples, etc. can all serve me for way less money and hassle.","stars":1}

Additionally the worker was rude though i believe it was not her intention she just knows no better.  When voicing my concern she abruptly cut me off and responded I can't tell my boss nothing I need my job. Ultimately being a small business the owners and the workers need to realize you want to appease the community in which your business is located.  Lack of community support equal closing of business. DO NOT PATRONIZE this business there is a UPS box located in this shopping center tape your package at home and drop in there.  Additionally USPS does not charge for tape neither does the other UPS Stores in this area.","stars":1}

Then he was arguing with me and a lady came from the back and PROCEEDED to argue with me and him. Absolutely ridiculous service both I'm assuming both the owners.

{"text":"I have used this place a lot in the past and found them to be very helpful and efficient. I had to go there recently to drop off a prepaid package. I called first to see if there was some sort of curbside drop off but was told I would have to bring the package inside. When I got there I was surprised there was no attempt to limit the number of people inside the very small space. I was also surprised that none of the staff were wearing masks. Since the purpose of masks is to protect others I would think this would be a positive statement for the business to make to their customers. And requiring employees to wear masks would tell them that their employers were concerned about their wellbeing.  Maybe businesses need to rethink the messages they are sending particularly the ones that are fortunate enough to be open.","stars":4}

{"text":"Had a bad experience dealing with this store.  I would think twice before using them.  My daughter used their services to ship boxes home at the end of the semester while at Vanderbilt.  They had a station set up in her dorm.  They lost one out of her 4 boxes this year.  The box was never picked up by UPS.  I deal with UPS in my job every day so I know that packages can get lost.  I filed a claim with UPS a week after she returned home in May.  After weekly calls to the store regarding this claim, they would always promise that the store manager would call me the next day and she never would call.  Week after week went by of me calling and them promising to call me with information about the claim.  Finally my husband called and read them the riot act and I received a claim check minus 1/2 the shipping charges two months later!!  The letter said that she just sent it because she didn't have my phone number...are you kidding me!!!!  They said that they could only give me half of the shipping charges because I packed it myself, even though the package never even shipped.  Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service.

{"text":"I'm glad that you've demonstrated that you evade the point of truth and veracity.   The very point of a receipt is for the customers' protection to prove that you received the package.   As you are stating, there is no evidence that you acknowledge receiving the package at all.  Anyone can have or take a picture of a tracking number.   This isn't rocket science to anyone except maybe you.   In terms of your insistence of being eco-friendly, why can you not scan the package there and then email a receipt to the customer so that the customer has proof that you did, in fact, accept and take custody of the damn package?   Or perhaps you can use biodegradable receipts if you believe that the receipts seldom used there do not breakdown over time in landfills.  I have been perfectly cordial to you at all times.  You simply don't like it apparently that former customers are unhappy with your strange business practice of not providing a receipt for packages that you take custody of.   That frankly is a bit puzzling and perhaps bizarre.  I counted three other reviews in which other former customers have complained about not getting receipts from you.   Rather than trying to win an exchange, perhaps you could get onboard with the normal practices of business in this country and provide receipts to every customer you serve in your store.  I know of 4 on Yelp that likely would still be your customers.   You've done this to yourself and introspection is a practice that you'd do well to engage in.   Good luck to you.   I wish you well in your future endeavors.  \n\nDavid C.","stars":1}

I was at the Mall to meet a friend which was very impromptu but I had to mail my HOA invoice since they are not in the 21st century to take payments over the phone and I had I throwback to the 80s send a fax. Talk about living in the past.  I should have got my 8-Track player out and put in the Smokey and Bandit tape with Jerry Reed. Nonetheless, I quickly accessed my Yelp application and saw that there was a UPS store on Milwaukee sandwiched in a strip mall that also has  Five Guys, FireHouse Subs and Happy Life CBD.\n\nI waked in and bright and cheery young cashier smiled and greeted me. We chatted about 'old tech' and then we started the clunky process of doing a cover sheet and sending a fax.  I checked out the LovePOP cards all while carrying on a friendly conversation. \n\nThe store is not large but has all that anyone would need to take care of business. There are PO Boxes, copy machines, office supplies and Saddle bags that are made in Idaho.  How'bout that! \n\nAnother customer arrived with an Amazon return and Amanda was efficient and pleasant. \n\nI felt bad that it was taking so long but she apologized saying that faxing these days depends on where it's being sent and the receiving fax.   Shortly thereafter, Amanda appeared from the back and greeted me and we talked some more about the LovePOP cards and the exquisite work involved to create the cards.  \n\nI handed over my envelope that needed to be mailed to the HOA and it was compliant with the old stamp that I had found in one of my desk drawers and moments later-  BRRRRRRRR-DINNNNNGGGGGGGG-DINNNNNNNG-BEEEEP_BLOOOPPPPPPPPP.   The fax was going through.  Wow. What a relief.  I felt like I was just crowned the MVP of the Super Bowl and I was getting to go to Disneyland but I was just as happy to pay $1.00 and get my confirmation letter. \n\nIf you're in a pinch and need to do some taking care of business with or without Bachman Turner Overdrive, then the UPS Store on Milwaukee is pitch perfect for your needs.","stars":5}

He said i needed to email the ups label to him and instead of just saying it, his laziness just kept tapping the piece of paper taped to the front of his register which forced my disabled self to painfully hobble around the counter to read the sign. Then he started complaining to another guy how slow the computers were but made a point of saying 2x that he was NOT going to be bothered to rectify the problem. When he returned with my label he asked where my package was without even looking at me. I has left the package on the other side of the  counter where i was originally standing and because he was too rude to even look up & i was in pain i used my cane to slide it in front of him. He held out my receipt without even looking at me, again, so damn rude. I took it and left. I will never return to this store if this is how he is allowed to treat customers. This jerk doesn't deserve to work there or anywhere with his disgusting attitude. The black guy behind the counter wasn't mistreating his customers. And the 3rd guy there, another white guy, just stood behind the wall silently watching this interaction and said nothing.

I've used them for printing services in the past and it's good to know they also make business cards, brochures, fliers and menu's for the business that wants a professional look. We'll be definitely using them again.","stars":5}

Her store feels like a small business in the way that she gets to know you and welcomes you every time you come in. If you're lucky, she may have her super lovable, well-behaved, sweet pup at the store, too! Go here next time you need to print, fax, copy, receive, or send anything!","stars":5}
{"text":"I had a handful of Amazon packages that I needed to return. I also wanted boxes to ship some of my art in and to ask a few questions about the process. I ended up at this location, located in an old bank. \n\nThe guy running the front counter had my 3 return packages scanned, labels printed and applied, and a return tracking slip in hand extremely quickly. He then helped me figured out what sized boxes would be best and most cost effective for my unique sized canvases, and gave me a few tips for shipping, as a small business owner. Very friendly and helpful, and much appreciated.","stars":5}
{"text":"Fantastic service today when picking up a large and heavy box.  It was way too heavy for me to lift...and even though it's COVID era, the nice lady with short white hair lifted it onto a dolly and helped me load it into the (very messy) trunk of my car.  Might seem like a small thing...but then so are my muscles.  I am eternally grateful!  All this from a location and convenience based business that does not need to compete by demonstrating excellent customer service...quite impressive!","stars":5}

Three guys working and all act completely annoyed at a consumer coming in, asking a question or any other manner of service.

Really disappointing to see a small, privately owned company perform like this, hope the owner sees this and starts to put some effort into providing better service.","stars":1}

This place is unbelievable. All I've ever done was pay to be a customer there. I cringe to think I've spent hundreds of dollars there. They'll never see another dime of my money.

Aside from the 5 minute wait in the cold (safety for Covid-19 prevents too many customers inside at a time) it was super easy and the young woman who helped me (Jazlyn) was simply the best!  She was cheerful and helpful and very sweet.  I snuck in right before closing, and although is was clear they had been slammed all day, she was so friendly and kind.

{"text":"Contents stolen from package...We shipped the package out of this store for Christmas. We specifically paid for two-day shipping so it would arrive well before Christmas. The package went back-and-forth between our location and the destination twice and sat at one stop for three days before it arrived after eight days....one day after Christmas. When we handed over our package to be shipped, the employee asked my wife what the contents of the package were. They should only ask if there are more any dangerous or hazardous contents and nothing more. The exact contents are otherwise none of their business. She naïvely answered their question in detail. When the package arrived at our family members' home, not only was it late, but the package had been cut open on the bottom. The contents had been removed and replaced with another random item that was never in our possession. The bottom had been poorly retaped with another type of tape other than our original tape. The theft obviously occurred within the UPS system and most likely at this store judging by the questions asked and the local markings on the item the thief used to replaced our items. My family member met the delivery driver on his end and we handed the package to the UPS store on our end. It never sat on our steps or the recipient's steps. It is obvious how this occurred, and where, with all the evidence we have gathered.","stars":1}

{"text":"The worst experience at any UPS in the Philadelphia/ South Jersey Area. Would never go back here and considering just not using UPS as my go-to carrier. The workers there are disrespectful and rude to say the least. They tried to charge me for something they should be doing for free. They make UPS look like scum. \nMy story: I had a large box (weighing over 30lbs) to mail out. I went to UPS this morning with my friend and his mask broke so while he stayed outside to fix it, I (a small figured woman) tried to take the big box in and when I walked in the workers were looking at me with their noses pointed (like I was below them). As I'm walking in, the handle on the box broke and all 3 or 4 of the workers began laughing loudly in a mocking way. I proceeded to the 2nd desk/cashier and she was so nasty. She didnt greet me or ask me what I needed. She didnt say a word just stood there and watched me. She saw that the box was too heavy for me and she wouldn't help me lift the box to put it on the counter or come around the counter to scan it. She watched me struggle and no other workers in the store offered to help either (they were all bigger/taller than me). Not only did she just stand there watching me without saying a word, she blurts out \"I'm going to charge you to tape up the box\"... um first of all amazon says that UPS will box/package my item for me at no charge... so I said no to paying for it.. so she wouldn't tape or finish packaging the box.","stars":1}

I went back to Amazon and requested free UPS pickup from my home.  The items have since been received by Amazon and I've received my credit.\n\nI think the clerk was dissing me because I bought the strap tape from Walgreens next door after she told me their tape was $11.99.  She also never weighed or lifted the package so she didn't how light or heavy it was.\n\nWell my previous inclination was right, poor, rude service.","stars":2}

Three days later they called to say they didn't have a confirmed address.  When I complained their only solution was to refund my money and not ship the package.  Owner/manager refused to assist in any way, in fact refused to even return a phone call or speak to me at all.  \n\nI have shipped from the Fowler UPS store near USF and the experience was completely different.  Efficient, friendly staff, who taped up my box and had all my information in their system without having to fill out any paperwork.   The Tampa Palms store charges $1 per tape strip.  I kid you not.  \n\nAs of today, package has still not been shipped and I have filed a formal complaint with UPS Store Corporate.   I feel as though I'm being held hostage by this extremely poorly managed store.  Very dissappointed.","stars":1}
{"text":"I had to go to the UPS Store to get something notarized since the FedEx website said that they no longer provide that service.  I waited a small amount of time while the chick at the counter was on the phone, but it was a customer and not her homie so it was ok.  She then notarized my paper and worked with me on delivery options.  All the while more people were coming in and waiting behind me and the phone was blowing up.  This girl needed to have some help there at 8AM - like when do people go to the UPS store?  Before work?  Yep.  She did a good job holding it together under stress though, I'll give her that.  Managers - give her some help in the AM! \n\nSo I didn't realize that UPS did regular mail delivery.  I also didn't realize that they make name tags, name plates for your desk, and even engrave license plate holders.  They have a small supply of envelopes, pens, office supplies too.  I guess I don't go to these stores very often but I thought these things were pretty cool.  A-OK","stars":3}

I learned the hard way....First, I need to return my package to Amazon, they took it and  gave me the tracking numbers, two weeks later, I have not heard anything from Amazon, I track the tracking numbers and it said: Shipment Ready for UPS. So this was my first time ever in years of being a customer with Amazon, I have NEVER had any issues when returning my purchase to any Location except this one in Odessa. I have to call the Amazon customer service for one hour and explain to them what happened, they said that it has been two weeks and they have NOT received! \nThen again, after that issue has been solved. I though that's just happened accidentally. I then again return one more item to Amazon. Then again, I have the same issue! Still today I looked up and it still said: Shipment Ready for UPS! \nOk, so you though I learned my lesson, but nope, since I'm on my way to work and this location is close to work and I just want to drop it off my return to Amazon, and guess what happen now?!?!..the Amazon return instruction said that I don't need to pack the item, I just need to drop it off. So that's what I did. But when I got there, the girl cashier told me the item need to be in the packing package and make me paid for the package! I don't mind paying for it, but the Amazon instruction said I don't need to pack it and that was just surprising. \nI'm going to tell all my friends and patients about this to beware when they do business here. \nFYI, when you go return items at this ups store, make sure don't be surprised by all these surprises you will get!","stars":3}

The second time another employee was talking on his phone while also talking to me, and I was very confused when he called one of us \"baby\".

This place has a cluttered/unfinished look to it and I've had difficulty finding shipping supplies that fit my needs.  The Greenwood UPS looks like it was designed with customers in mind and looks like a place that you can get a lot of things done besides simply shipping a package.  As I've said in the Greenwood review, I often drive the 10 miles instead of the 2 if I am going to need to deal with the service counter.  \n\nOn my most recent visit, I was the only one in the place and I wasn't even greeted when I came in to drop off a prepaid package.

If they spot someone walking up tot he store with a big or heavy item, they'll come out to help or at least open the door for you.  Just today, I was trying to figure out how to transport my TVs for this move. They took the time to make a price estimate, and were honest with me that the price was unreasonable for what the TVs were worth.

They were overjoyed that the cops would come and rough me up so I would leave. They also promised to never serve me again because of my attitude. I stood there for 25 minutes and Katrina called the cops on me and pretended that I was a threat saying she felt so unsafe and didn't know what I was capable of, which is a good way to get a person of color killed. Extremely racist. She used both her female form and racism as an attack on me. It was disgusting. I've already reported them to corporate. The fools who work at this UPS can rot in hell.","stars":1}

I don't at all appreciate being lied to and for all of this, I will not be using this store again for my shipping needs.  Of no surprise, is that many other reviews of this store were complaints that a receipt was not given.","stars":1}

But get this...and I am going to amazon about this. They scan your return as soon as you go to the desk, then tell you you have to put into a shipping box which my return already has a box, try to charge you, then when you refuse to buy their box, you are then left taking your package out of the store and they processed it as returned! They know what they are doing in this local scam!!!!! They did it to me and I warned my wife, and she just found out they did it to her. \n\nWe are filing a complaint with amazon and want the public around our area to know about this scam they are doing. The associates know exactly what they are doing as was sarcastically said to \"have a good night!\".","stars":1}

When I was in the store there was a young male employee, who wore glasses, arguing loudly with someone over what appeared to be speaker phone. I've read other reviews and he appears to get the same bad review each time.\n\nEventually this \"man's\" bad attitude began carrying over to customers. He snapped at a customer when he was asked an innocent question. The gentleman behind the counter assisting me, as opposed to the young male arguing with people while doing fingerprints, is the reason I'm not giving this business one star.","stars":2}

I went to the UPS store with my receipt and they were so rude un helpful looked at me like I was from another planet. As far as I know my envelope is still sitting in their office some where. They refused to help me look for it. They blamed the post office who have no record of ever receiving the envelope. I would not recommend useing this place for anything! I am still trying to find my envelope with my check. Oh and they charged me double what USPS would have charged me to send the same thing! Double the price and no tracking in their system that I was ever there even though I have a receipt from them go figure!","stars":1}

The notary showed up but proceeded to head across the parking lot with another employee leaving one person to handle the 3 customers waiting.

When another customer walks into the store she also tells her to wait I felt that to be strange\nWhile she and the printer guy were fixing the printer. They were talking about the possible issues the printer has and going over each one while we wait now. \nThen I ask Jody can you please help me I have to leave \nI walked in the store at 3pm why do I have to wait until 3:09 to be helped it's boring and disrespectful to my time! \nThe printer can be handle once you have taking care of the customers you have in front of you first\nAlso when I asked could she help me the printer guy told me to shut up I was stunned shocked and could not believe he said that. He must be a punk what guys talks to a women like that \nAt the end she said she was not going to help me and scanned my package back in the system be returned it to carrier just to be nasty!!!!! \nThe other lady asked a question and she snapped on her as well. \nI felt like I was being ganged up on just because I asked her for help, and she was busy with the printer guy! \nI called the police then she called the police \nThis situation could of all been avoided by good customer service \nThe police came and took my statement as well as hers and at the end I told her to have a good life because ppl like them will never win \nI will never go back there again!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"I returned three sweaters to Amazon more than two weeks ago.  They were all different packages.  When I wasn't getting my money back, I looked them up.  It shows that two were scanned, but never left the store.  The other didn't have a receipt or tracking.  Terry B. took the bags and I could feel negativity, but I figured she was just overwhelmed before the holidays.  Not one of the sweaters made it back either via UPS or Post office.  I went back to the store to send back a fireplace.  I talked to Terry about it.  Rather than looking for the sweaters, she immediately got defensive.  She said \"amazon packages get lost all the time\".  Actually, no they don't.  I have never had this problem and now I have three with her at once.  At this point, I got nervous for my fireplace.  But, I left with the store owners name and number.\n\nTerri put the return label for the fireplace on the bottom of the box.  So, the 57 pound item was returned to me.  I had to send it again.\n\nI called Tom, the owner, because my alarm bells went off.  He was dismissive and rude.  I won't be back.  Tom owns two stores.  It seems he has lit up one star reviews in his other store.\n\nTurns out, Staples took my fireplace back and they were nice to me.  What a debacle.  Save yourself the headache and send with reputable people.","stars":1}

{"text":"I'm so sad to write this review as I love coming to this UPS to complete my shipping and printing needs and have for 2 years. There is an older woman with short grey hair who works here that is always so rude and angry towards costumers. This is typical behavior from her and I usually just let it go but today she was rude to multiple customers for no reason whatsoever. The first few times that this has happened I chalked it up to her having a bad day (everyone has them!). For her- every day must be a bad day. Everyone else that works at this location is so kind and helpful it's a shame that whenever I walk in I cross my fingers that she isn't working on that particular day. Today she crossed the line with her combative behavior (totally unprompted) and I will be calling tomorrow to put in a formal complaint. Its almost like she feels angry that she's working or something. It's so bad that you can see peoples energy deflate after having to deal with her. This store is usually awesome and unfortunately she ruins that and makes shopping here a negative experience. \n\nOnce this issue is resolved I plan to change my review to 5 stars as this is a great store outside of her presence. Bottom line is that she is in the wrong line of work and should be doing something where she doesn't have to interact with other people.","stars":1}

The store has all the shipping supplies you could need just at higher prices than a big box store.\n\nSometimes I have a return shipment already labeled by the party I did business with and it is just a matter of dropping off the package.  This is real easy to accomplish.  This is usually the primary reason for coming to this store.","stars":3}

I was informed that they were under new ownership and that this is the new policy. Apparently instead of just printing out things for you now, they charge you for \"computer time\". Yeah, it's just 3 bucks, but I don't appreciate being nickled and dimed.\nI'll take all my other business elsewhere.","stars":2}

Whoever damaged this cooler at The UPS Store # 5145 know they did it, packaged and shipped after they did it. When I called the store the guy that answered the phone was very very rude (to say in a nice way). Did not apologize or even act with any concern or care that someone in this small store damaged someones rare property. Just said someone from UPS will eventually call and hung up on me.

They have 24 hour access keys but only to your mailbox so if you have packages you will have to wait until the store hours.

Between yelling at the staff, customers, and being in a generally sour mood, I am definitely going to take my business elsewhere.

It's convenient as far as location (across from the giant State Store - I know, what a point of reference, right), as far as hours (they're only closed on Sunday), and they do so much more for you than any post office in this city by far... try getting a federal employee to stay open an extra 20 minutes because you're stuck in traffic, or to keep your box open on good faith because you didn't make it in by your renewal date.\n\nAlso, unlike the Post Office, they will accept and sign for any packages from any shipping company... AND e-mail you to let you know a package has arrived!\n\nI never really know where I'll be from day-to-day, and I have MAJOR issues with mail or package delivery at home, so I gladly fork over $20/month to have Carol, Lauren and their team handle all of that for me.","stars":5}

I was visibly upset thinking back to when the last time I actually saw my wallet was! MaryAnn was patient and understanding and even let me go out to search my car. When I still couldn't find it, she gave me her card and said just to call with the credit card number when I do find it. She kept the shipment so I didn't have to worry about coming back in either. She handled the transaction over the phone and even scanned the receipt to me since I needed it for work expenses.

But tonight I walked into the store at 3 minutes to 7 and closing time is 7.  The guy behind the counter could not have been more friendly and helpful and told me no need to apologize for coming in last minute.  He weighed, measured my items and found a box to ship them in. Printed my label and took my payment. I was out the door right at 7 and never felt rushed or like I was a bother to him at the end of a long day. They have earned my business AND my positive review.

{"text":"Stay far away from this location! In late September, I as moving from Tampa, to NY. I brought a TV into this location and asked their advice for shipping it. MaryAnn confidently assured me that she had been trained and could custom pack the TV. With insurance, the price came to approximately $300! Had MaryAnn not been so reassuring I would have sold the television locally or done something else. Sure enough the TV was significantly damaged in transport. I called UPS to explain what happened and they demanded I file a claim immediately ... take pictures of the damage immediately! I complied and they approved my claim within a day. It's now a month and a half later and I have not received any money even though the TV was insured for $500, even though the claim was approved. All MaryAnn offers is a chain of excuses, pointing the finger at other people in her organization. She needs yet another approval, or yet another signoff. Clearly her reputation and her word mean nothing to her.","stars":1}
{"text":"DO NOT SHIP ANYTHING HERE! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOTHING! THE OWNER IS INCREDIBLY RUDE! My fiancé and I used this store recently to ship multiple expensive objects across the country. We spent over two grand and were promised insurance on the packages as well as being promised they would package the items properly in bubble wrap. They did none of this, they took our money, slapped their labels on the outside of the object (a very expensive DJ case) and shipped it as is. When it arrived damaged and we attempted to file a claim, the owner and store repeatedly lied to their parent company to cover their own mistakes. THEY ARE A FRANCHISE STORE SO THEY SAY ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE PARENT COMPANY. Not only this, but they lost our snowboards entirely (perhaps they simply stole them?) and refuse to communicate with us about their whereabouts. The owner is an unreasonable and rude man who swears at his own customers (including insulting my disabled veteran fiancé). DO NOT SHIP ANYTHING HERE!!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"ATTN USAA MEMBERS - READ THIS WARNING\nI took my $5,393.90 check to be deposited into my account (the first time I've done that at this location). The employee carelessly only entered in $393.90. My husband noticed that the full amount hadn't posted nearly an hour later. I called the UPS store and they tried to tell me it was because it's a larger check and it would take a few days. I know that to be not true as I've been a USAA member for 4 years since my husband joined the Army. He said that he would look into it and call me back (and then proceeded to hang up on me without saying another word!!). I immediately called USAA and the woman I spoke with said it would automatically correct itself in 2 business days, but that the lady at the UPS had \"missed the 5\" on the check. Since I deposited it on a Saturday (today), I am short $5,000 for 4 days. The man at the UPS store (Paul I think) called me back and said that if I came down to the store, they would be able to fix it by calling USAA. I take my break from work and when I get there Paul calls USAA and hands the phone to me. They tell me the same 2 business day thing and it's out of their hands. So I wasted time and money to come down and them to tell me the same thing?! Not the representative's fault, but the UPS store's. Neither one of the employees there seemed to understand that this lady's mistake has shorted me $5,000 for 4 days! They did not seem to understand how much that could affect someone's life!! This UPS location is giving USAA and UPS a bad name. They have been rude every other time I've been in there for other reasons and they barely speak any English. I know I will never be setting foot in there again, but I feel responsible for warning other USAA members to take their checks and money to the store location in Cool Springs - it's farther away, but at least I know they know how to read numbers and enter in checks correctly!!!!! I love USAA and everything they do for our service members, but this UPS store should not be associated with the wonderful banking company of USAA.

Now granted, its often more the customers than the employees, like the lady who brought in a big box full of trinkets and made the line of customers wait while she had the gal working there wrap each piece individually in bubble wrap and tape...  I stood in line for 15 minutes... left, came back 20 minutes later and they still hadnt finished.... and the lady was just standing there, along with all the people in line that were there when I walked in earlier.  Hey Lady, TRY WRAPPING THAT STUFF YOURSELF!  That is instead of being completely inconsiderate and making the other 6 people wait for the 2 girls working there to get through with you and your wrapping job.  \n\nBut that said, the bigger issue is how under-staffed this place is... it always two gals, and there is ALWAYS a line ... that takes FOREVER!  So, Mr UPS store owner, the question is this... Do you spring for an additional employee or two so we can get on with our day?  Or do you lose business because the public is sick of waiting cuz you're too cheap to keep the place properly staffed?  Its your call, all I know is ... after spending an hour going back and forth here, and still not getting my package shipped... I walked over to, yes, that right, the post office, where i waited about 1 minute and ended up spending about half of what I would have here.... the only bummer was, I got there too late to ship my package overnight due to all the time I wasted at the UPS store.  I will NOT make that mistake again.  Cheers. //SS","stars":1}

I just wish I could do it in the convenience of my own home.  \n\nUpdate:  I did not go with the business cards here.  I did not want to stand and give my order at a station.

{"text":"The location for this store could not be more perfect. One would think that while you're on campus and you need to mail something or buy postage it should be an easy and positive experience. Unfortunately, every visit I have to make to this location is met with unprofessional and rude behavior from the staff that works there. I have worked in customer services for over 11 years and I never experienced this level or rudeness from a rep in my life. I understand that your job must feel mundane and often times working with students can be annoying because they too are rude and inconsiderate but to throw your terrible attitude at a customer that is looking for your opinion on what type of box and/or package you should chose for your precious piece of mail is completely uncalled for. I'm so tired of the people working the counter that continue to think it's okay to treat customers this way. I hate that I have to use this location. Do not take your bad mood out on your customers! The employees do get the job done and they are knowledgeable but that is just about the only thing going for this place. Plain and simple, know your audience and keep your bad mood and hatred for your job to yourself. Better yet, get another job.

Two were going to me and the third to my friend. One to me was already sealed and the others had to be packed. When they packed the packages, the labels were switched. Only when they arrived did we realize the mistake. I called the store and they gave me the runaround. I called UPS and they said it was a franchise and I had to deal with the store. I also spoke with a UPS manager who said he would also talk with the store manager, Jay.\nTwo days later, I got a call from the UPS manager telling me to expect a call from Jay. All I wanted was to be re-imbursed for original shipping. I would pay to get them to proper addresses. Jay did call and was very tactless in telling me that it was a matter of he said, she said and that he had no intention of re-imbursing me. He implied that I made the mistake. Since the boxes were very different in size, I would not have been confused. It happened in the packing room which was out of sight. I might add that the store was busy.\nWith so many UPS stores in Tucson, go to a different location. This team is shoddy, makes errors and doesn't own up to their mstakes.","stars":1}

Amazon charges $1 to send the labels to UPS if you don't have a printer. I have used this option many times. At this particular UPS store they charge you $3 for creating the label (it is also $3 for 5min to use their computer to print it out yourself!). NEVER have I ever been charged for this!

The guy behind the counter started to help us under the lady manager stepped in to assist. My friend who is an attorney started to ask the questions except they weren't the right questions. He asked how their shipping prices compared to other companies. I did all I could do to prevent laughing out loud. Of course, they will tell you they are comparable.\n\nI made mental notes of the box prices of the two sizes I may need. I finally broke into my friend's conversation with the manager. I asked point blank what the rates were shipping these two size boxes with estimated weights of 20, 30, and 40 pounds to the specific locations. \n\nWe left with the pricing and shopped around then came back to ship the three boxes. Since we did not buy the boxes here and were going to use a business UPS account, the store was going to make zero on us. Keep this in mind for the remained of the event.\n\nWe came in two days later with the packed heavy boxes. There were three customers in the store ahead of us so we were prepared to wait. We carried the heavy boxes to the far back counter to be out of the way. The same guy is there taking care of the 3 customers in line. The female manager comes out of the back and remembers us so comes straight over. I tell her we will be using a business account to ship the packages. She hands me three airbills and says \"You have to fill these forms in for that\". Then turns around and walks to the back again. We never saw her again. After filling in the forms, the guy gives us our receipt.\n\nI understand they would not be making money over our transaction but leaving us to go to the back was just plain rude.

{"text":"Allie K - I'm going to group you in with Holly C with regard to your negative review in that a store like this should have to greet you with \"Your Majesty\" upon entering THEIR store. It is YOUR responsibility to FIRST and FOREMOST walk into the store (without your heavy package) and ASK if you can get assistance from one of the staff members with your parcel in the event it was heavy and you suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. I absolutely doubt they would not send someone out to assist in this instance. In the event they would not assist in shipping it, there most likely was a reason why as there are certain things they can and cannot ship (wine being one of them they cannot if you bring the bottle or case into the store) due to State laws (please review the NRS statue that pertains to shipping alcohol). I also cannot agree with the fact that they wouldn't help you back out to your car with it (most likely because you didn't ask for assistance in doing so). So before you go pointing the finger, please note that there are three other fingers pointing back at you when doing so and you may want to take your own \"customer service\" skills into consideration which tells me I would not want to visit the location or store you work at simply because of how you think you should be treated based on what your opinion is of \"good customer service\". \n\nPaul M - Since YOU were the one who shipped the item, it is YOUR responsibility to follow up on it from a claim perspective. Parcels could get damaged or broken during transit and it's good you purchased insurance. I find it extremely difficult to believe they wouldn't honor the insurance. This store is ran like a Swiss watch and the staff knows exactly what they're doing. The same thing could have happened had you used FedEx. Your smear campaign pertaining to the review of this location doesn't hold water. \n\nSean S - When you enter a store involved in the packaging and freight business, you are on THEIR time. They are not on YOURS. It is THEIR job to wrap each and every item carefully so it arrives at its destination UNDAMAGED. After all, you wouldn't want something you're trying to ship to arrive in a hundred little pieces around the holidays, would you? My suggestion - take a few extra minutes and allow more time for locations like this to get the job done. It sounds like you have a patience problem more than shipping problem. This location is not understaffed one bit. They just don't have enough people working there when YOU'RE there, which just sounds incredibly selfish. \n\nHolly C - Zhong is about the nicest and most accommodating person I've probably met in my entire life. I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about him and his staff. It's disappointing you took more time out of your day to write a negative review just because you weren't greeted with \"Your Majesty\" upon entering the store. \n\nI've been going to this location for many years and have never once had a poor experience. They're quick, efficient, courteous, and really know what they're doing. I've shipped so many things from here and have never had anything damaged in the process of doing so. They're very quick to help if all you give them is a little bit of your time and patience. That's what shipping stores are all about. \n\nKudos to you, UPS Store! Keep up the fine work!","stars":5}

Unfortunately, everything had to be written down and there weren't any brochures on what the prices are and what you would receive for that price. I do like the pricing, the fact that it was full color, and I can add my QR code on the back. Also, I like that I would get it back in two business days.

{"text":"I just had the most infuriating experience at this UPS store.\n\nI'm a Temple employee and alumna and have been shipping packages here for the past 13 years. This is literally the only joint that I ship packages out of, because it's conveniently located near my job.\n\nI always mail my boxes the same way. I get an old box, usually from an Amazon shipment, put the stuff in it, and wrap it securely with SHIPPING PAPER. Today I did just that and arrived to be told that they won't ship a box if it has shipping paper on it. I literally had wrapped the entire box in clear packing tape after covering it with the paper, so I was very confused as to why this was a problem. Andrew, the guy I was dealing with, told me that they can't ship it with paper in case the paper rips. I pointed out that literally the entire box was covered in clear packing tape so it would be impossible for it to rip. It would actually be MUCH more likely for the shitty box that I used to rip or dent or break than it would have been for the packing tape and the packing paper to both get ripped.\n\nI asked how much a box would cost - just a box to put my box inside of, and he told me it would cost $26.00. For a box. For one box. \n\nNo.\n\nI then asked him if he had a pair of scissors to cut the paper off the box, since I packaged it with the expectation that I would be handled roughly and that the person on the receiving end of the box would have a pair of scissors to unwrap it. He said no. No scissors at all. I then had to proceed to struggle to rip the packing paper and packing tape off the damn box because I had packaged it so that nothing could permeate it. Apparently using a box that has markings all over it, with a previous shipping label on it, is preferable to shipping a box that I spent 15 minutes tightly securing.\n\nAs if that wasn't annoying enough, Andrew was absolutely INSISTENT that I list every single item in my box. Mind you, every time I come here I usually list \"paper, plastic, glass, electronics, etc.\" I never get insurance on my packages, and no one has ever given me a hard time.\n\nNot Andrew. Andrew wanted to know every single item in my box. \n\nThis was beyond a frustrating experience. I kept telling him there were several items (at least 8 or 9) in the box, most of which I couldn't even REMEMBER anymore, and that there were simple paper and plastic items in it. He refused to process my order until I told him what was inside. I get that they want to make sure there are no flammable or dangerous items in your packages, but that question was never posed to me. \n\nIf UPS is going to have rules, then they need to be applied by every single employee of the store. Either Andrew was giving me a hard time for no reason, or all of the other employees I've ever encountered here are utterly incompetent, because I have never, ever, in my entire 13 years of going here, had any of the obstacles that Andrew placed in front of me today.\n\nUPS, what the fuck are you doing? Get your shit together.\n\n***\n\nEDIT: I called the complaint line for UPS (1800-789-4623) and was told the following:\n1. While UPS doesn't like to ship things with paper wrapping, if you tell the associate to ship it anyway, they should do it for you.\n2. They are not permitted to ask for every single item in your box. Saying \"paper, plastic, clothes, electronics\" is more than acceptable.\n3. The woman I spoke with was \"dumbfounded\" that Andrew would not let me use a pair of scissors to remove the paper. \"Of course he has scissors,\" she says.","stars":1}

He opened it up, sorted quickly through the paperwork and repacked it into a special box they use for this. In maybe five minutes my modem was repacked and on it's way with nothing required from me but a signature. This was possibly the most efficient I've ever seen a shipping center process a package, and the whole time with excellent customer service.","stars":4}

The staff helped me get the design elements I needed - including correct graphics and fonts, sizing/resolution, layout, etc.  They even walked through the process with me in-store and made adjustments based on my specifications to ensure everything turned out exactly right.\n\nFor someone who knows WHAT they want, but not HOW to make it happen, the staff at this UPS store is the magic that connects the dots.  They helped me turn my creative vision into a beautifully finished final product.\n\nThank you, guys!  You rock!  :)","stars":5}

I doubted that and took my package to the local USPS who sent it for $23.75. It appears that the markup at this UPS is ridiculously high and I will avoid this store in the future.","stars":1}

They printed it on heavy, bright paper, looked it over to make sure the margins and spacing looked okay, made plenty of copies, put them in a cardboard envelope to keep them clean and I was on my way.  They're friendly and efficient, and not expensive at all.  If (when!) I secure a job in Center City, I'll use them for all my shipping needs!","stars":5}

{"text":"This is the Odessa store located on Gunn & Van Dyke Road. \n\nI have a choice of 6 UPS stores to drop boxes off to within 10 minutes or less from my home. I usually come to this one (further from me than the one on Gunn/Ehrlich & Sheldon in Citrus Park) for these reasons:\n\n1. 6:30pm UPS pick up time. This store's pick up time is later than 4 of the other stores (the one on Hillsborough/Memorial has a 6:30pm pickup too. So, I work from home but I don't get off until 5pm. So, this means if I'm sending out a package, I don't have the stress of rushing to one of the 5:30pm stores.\n\n2. The owner weighs and takes account for ever box no matter what. My packages are always pre-labeled, so I can just do a drop-off and trust that UPS will scan my box and pick it up, but the owner at this location. The owner takes good care of your boxes. \n\n3. The owner will give you an honest assessment of your packaging if he thinks UPS will damage your box. \n\n4. The owner doesn't treat me any differently because my boxes are pre-paid for. (I'll do a review of the one on Gunn in Citrus Park....the only store that has given me crap for using my own shipping account, so you understand this statement)\n\nCon:\nThe owner must take a break every once in a blue moon and when he does he has one employee that is not so attentive and locks up before closing time if the UPS truck is done picking up packages. This employee says, 'dropping off'? then tells drop off customers to leave their boxes to the side and has even told us to leave boxes next to the UPS truck outside on the sidewalk!  Again, my boxes are pre-labeled and paid for, so dropping off without weighing doesn't matter, but the sense of urgency for this kid to go home is apparent....and I watched the UPS guy scan and put my boxes in the truck before leaving the day I had to leave boxes on the sidewalk.\n\nCon 2, but not a big deal:\nI'm not in the store long enough for it to bother me, but the owner burns candles or incense or something that is extremely overpowering when you walk into this location. I have a very good nose, so anything overpowering can cause me to get nauseous especially anything too floral (there's something about faking the scent of flowers that doesn't sit well with me). Since I can't pin down whether the scent is floral or musky, I think he has several scents going on at once, which is even worse for my nose. I brace myself when coming here because of the scent that I know will hit me when I walk in. It's not a bad smell, but it's overpowering. Again, I'm not in the store long enough for it to be an issue. I can also see how someone else would really like the scents.","stars":4}

After getting this GIANT HEAVY box installed, it did not have the Streampix or HBO and my bill increased an extra $20/month.  No thank you.  Wanting to avoid the 7th circle of hell known as the Comcast Service Center, and waiting in line for an hour to return the thing, I called and discovered that Comcast has an agreement with UPS Stores where they will pack and ship your box for free.  \n\nTen days before Christmas at lunch time, short lines, congenial staff of young men who discussed the new D'Angelo album with me, I walked out less than 10 minutes later a happy customer.

Then he starts to wrap up my item in one of their boxes and I asked him \"around how much would this be\".. I asked this bc I didn't want him wrapping it up and wasting material if I wasn't going to want the service. I should be able to know an approximate amount prior and as the owner he should be able to tell me.. of course he ignores me.. tells me it's going to be $13-15 (AFTER wrapping it all up) which is more than I wanted to spend. (Btw, just shipped it with USPS at $6.80 tracked and $50 free insurance & with superb customer service!) Long story short... I asked him if he was the owner and he said yes and I told him his management sucked and I don't know how he stayed in business. We own a business on old hickory blvd and so I know what it takes to run a business, I couldn't imagine treating my customers the way he does his.

Now, no sooner do I step in the door than there's a \"Hi Jess\" and my packages are on the counter while I'm still opening my mailbox to pick up the delivery slips. \n\nThey do all kinds of other things here too - recently we changed our locks at home and I was pleased to discover that I didn't have to take a separate trip to the hardware store because they could make copies of my new key for me right there. They also make photocopies and (obviously) provide outgoing shipping services. There are usually one or two other customers in the store when I go in, but it's never crowded and I rarely have to wait more than a minute or two for service even at their busiest times.\n\nThe only downside I can think of about this place is that their actual address is a little screwy - you're officially supposed to have things shipped to 1229-1231 Chestnut St. PMB ###, and I've found that some online stores do address autocorrection and won't accept that address format.

{"text":"This UPS store is located in the Student Center at Temple University's main campus. They offer not only UPS services, but also USPS services. When you want to ship a package, they'll tell you the rates that UPS offers, and the rates that USPS offers. They have tracking, return receipts, etc... basically everything that you'd expect from a stand-alone shipping center.\n\nThe hours of operation are posted on Temple's website, but they're wrong. It says they open at 8:30, but they really open at 9:30. The lines can sometimes be long considering it's the only mailing center on campus, but you always get what you need.\n\nI recommend putting your envelopes in a blue mailbox on the street because I find when I drop my letters off here it takes a while for them to get sent out. Packages are a different story and tend to get shipped out much quicker.","stars":3}
{"text":"This is the UPS store in the Savemart shopping center on N. McCarran in NW Reno. It offers shipping, copying, and fax services. I've used these folks for packing and shipping on a handful of occasions and have always been happy with the experience. They pack things up quickly and carefully and get you out of the store in a reasonable time. Service has always been pretty good and the folks behind the counter are friendly and helpful.","stars":4}

{"text":"I was stunned to be charged $107.00 to receive 5 boxes for an event at the Omni Hotel in Nashville.  They have a captive audience and can charge whatever they like, but it would have been nice if they told me about this fee when I called two times to let them know I was shipping boxes for my arrival.  That was almost twice as much as it cost to ship them across the country and I felt is was a bit excessive.  I questioned the onsite manager Kaitlin about the charge, but she did nothing.  Had I known about this, I would have sent the boxes to friends in the area.  Businesses need to make money and this is no doubt an expensive location to be, but communication is important.  I emailed the regional manager Chris and have yet to hear from him, which I just think is bad business.  Occasionally, I need to use places like this but based on this franchisees business practices, I'll pass on The UPS Store and go to Fed Ex.","stars":1}
{"text":"This store gets a Zero for customer service.  My wife went in to drop off a small parcel for return to Sears.  The shipping label was larger then the box so we didn't tape the box shut in case we were instructed to put the larger label in the box and UPS would generate a smaller label.\n\nThe clerk proceeds to tell my wife that she needs to come in prepared with the box taped shut.  Then tells her that her options are to go home and tape it shut or buy their $6 roll of tape, so she buys the tape.  The clerk then proceeds to take the package and says he'll take care of taping it with his tape gun. Pretty bad sales tactic for a $6 roll of tape.","stars":1}

If you live in West chase and shop at Publix, this is convenient and worth supporting.","stars":5}

{"text":"Stay away from this establishment. One of the most unprofessional businesses I have ever attempted to do business with in my life. They never answer their phones or get back to their customers. We bad professional business cards made here and waited and tried calling 100 times to see if they were ready. Finally we got a hold of the person who we were working with and she informed us the cards had been ready for a WEEK, she was just too busy to drop them off or let us know! She could have informed us of that, and we would have been glad to pick  them up ourselves. Then she promised to deliver them that same day, and again we failed to receive them. The following day someone finally dropped them off, but we were horrified to see that the whole business card was had another employees information on it, and to really top it off they charged a former employees personal credit card for our order!!! We have now attempted to call this store 10 times to get a resolution and no one will answer. BEWARE of this place.","stars":1}

{"text":"Everyone here is always so helpful and nice. I have had a box with them for over 2 years now and have had no problems. It's pricier than a po box, but they accept delivery on everything, not just us mail.\n\nThe only thing is that you HAVE to be sure to tell people sending you stuff to put \"PMB\" on US mail stuff. The UPS Store has the same address as the Adelphia House, so if someone puts \"#\" or \"Apt\" instead of \"PMB\" it will get routed to Adelphia and you may or may not get it. \n\nSuper happy with the service here.","stars":5}

How am I getting these items on the plane? How will I back these items in my suitcase?

I know and understand they charge more since they aren't a post office, 20% more is usually the ticket. So your normal .47 stamp would be .60 no big deal. But 200% more??? No thanks.

{"text":"Disappointing I go in to have a package shipped just regular United States postal Service 'oh my machine is not working' really put a sign up before I have to stand in line for 10 minutes.  And the staff could have at least offered a satellite location instead of me having to find one.","stars":1}
{"text":"Service was friendly & efficient. I asked if the costs were the same as the main UPS store (several miles away) & the answer was, \"yes\".  Good to know since this location was only a couple miles from my home.","stars":5}

{"text":"This store is severely run poorly. I mailed a package from here and insured it. UPS broke the contents and then refused to honor the insurance I purchased. The employees at this store did an awful job keeping me informed during the month it took for the claim to be assessed. My suggestion use FedEx. If that isn't an option use a different ups store. This franchisee is horrible.","stars":1}
{"text":"Not every UPS Store is the same, I have used many UPS Stores but this store in Land O' Lakes is my favorite.

Jenn and Zhong in particular are always kind and are intensely competent at what they do. Zhong offers mobile notary services, which has been a lifesaver for us when we needed it. \n\nI've used this location for a fairly complicated mail marketing campaign and they made it so easy for me. I also have my PO box here and love that I can access it after hours with a code.","stars":5}

I will always use this UPS store to ship all of my packages over anybody else.","stars":5}

After finally getting to the right part of the huge odd shaped building on Temple U's Campus at about 4:55 pm, I was directed by a girl at the information desk, which direction to walk but I still could not find the store. I went back to the information desk, just for the girl to tell me in the span of about 4 minutes that the store had closed at 5:00 pm. I told her that the UPS website says the store closes at 6:00 pm she told me that the new time has not been updated yet to reflect correctly on UPS's website. Needless to say I was beyond pissed after lugging a 50 pound box and paying $7.00 for an Uber just to find out I had to go to a different location and pay another $7.00 for an Uber. :-( Don't waste your time going here.","stars":1}

{"text":"Manager is very dishonest and rude. First time I visited the store a lady (that previously had shipped a package) had some questions and because she wasn't buying anything he told the new employee that was in training that when a customer is not buying or shipping anything to please discharge the customer as soon as possible and not to waste time, he told the lady to go on the website because he couldn't help her. \nI tried to shipped (via USPS) a perfume to a family member in Europe, they charged me $84.05. A week after the package was returned by US Customs due to prohibited items. The manager never told me that perfumes were not aloud. When I stopped by the store to request a refund he told me I needed to go to the USPS if I wanted my money back because he had nothing to do with that. I went to the Postal Office and they told me that since The UPS store manage the shipment and they charge me, they were the ones responsible for my refund. I called UPS corporate office and they told me that the Postal Office was correct. The Manager of the UPS store is suppose to refund me and if he denied they encourage me to file a claim at their corporate office. I went back to the UPS store spoke to the Manager and when he saw that I had the Corporate offices phone number and email, he said \"I am sorry about that, I will refund your money now\". He knew all this time that it was his responsibility, he is just a very rude and dishonest person. Other then him, the rest of the staff is nice. It's a shame they have to work for someone like him. So if you are using this store just be careful because this manager is not an honest customer service orientated person.","stars":1}
{"text":"The people and service at this location is fantastic! I come here on a regular basis, and the staff are always very friendly and incredibly efficient. They make me actually enjoy the process of sending packages! A big bonus is that they take packages with USPS labels too.","stars":5}
{"text":"Don't usually post yelp reviews but saw some negative posts and felt compelled to share my opinion/experience w this business.  I've used them multiple times for a variety of shipments and it's never been anything but a positive experience.  Excellent, warm, customer service and professionalism.  I believe it's family run and it absolutely feels that way when you are there.  Feel good about this place! They're good people and they've always gone out of their way to get the job done.","stars":5}

She helped me save a lot of money with her knowledge and experience and I can't thank her enough!

{"text":"WARNING: Two days ago the manager, \"Tom,\" said I could have a UPS overnight package delivered to this location (Temple student center) for my daughter to pick up and the cost would be $10.80. Today, she was charged $21.60. I called to ask why this was and Tom said it was the owner's decision to double the price. He would not tell me who the owner is, and my intuition tells me Tom is being less than truthful. I can't trust this place. Temple and UPS corporate will be getting a letter about this.","stars":1}

Not only is the customer service prompt, but they are very organized. It also helps when the UPS reps are friendly and make you feel at ease. \n\nLike I said, I can't speak for other locations but this location is awesome!","stars":5}

Probably won't use this UPS store again.","stars":1}
{"text":"It was super easy dropping off a package that I had and they put the label I had printed out on it for me.  The only thing is they do NOT have the free UPS boxes for Express and you have to buy a generic box or bubble bag from them if you need a shipping box/bag.","stars":3}

I'm sure he (or anybody else) would be confused and curious if he had to pay money out his own pocket as well. \n\nI've been a temple student in undergrad and now graduate study down at the health science campus. 2-3 years ago, I had no problem with this place.

{"text":"I just started using this place recently and I'm really starting to appreciate it because the post office around the corner is always packed. Tracking numbers being standard is really a plus. On the downside, they don't have media mail which I really need for shipping records. Another thing is that I wish their boxes were cheaper. Similar boxes are a couple of dollars less at nearby Staples.\n\nAnyway, I've had great customer service here so I'll be switching up from USPS more often.

However, their customer service is the worst that I've experienced in a very long time.  I was unclear about how to mail a package with a prepaid mailing label.  The young woman, who is also a notary, provided a curt and unclear explanation, sending me to the back of the line after each incomplete answer.  Will never return to this store.","stars":2}

My daughter who is old enough to drive but still figuring out how the world works was dropping a package off for me. She thought I said UPS although I said the post office. It had a label on it that said no postage necessary and instead of directing her to the post office they charged her $15 to ship it. Completely unprofessional and shady.","stars":1}

I brought in a prepaid package but this being my first time having to use a commercial invoice, I wasn't sure what to do with them, and the kid was very unhelpful and yet tries to sound so clever.  Then when I kind of sighed and looked behind him to what looked like his manager/older relative, he wasn't helpful either.  The kid seemed like a high school part timer and definitely needs to learn simple customer service basics.  Oh and when I paid him cash, he didn't even ring up the register.","stars":1}

His birthday gift was there waiting for him when he got to the office and he was very surprised and pleased with his gift. \n\nThis location isn't the closest UPS Store to me, but I am fond of this location because the staff is very friendly here.

She nodded toward the woman with the cell phone as if that answered my question. The cell-phone woman acted like it was a huge inconvenience but took my photo again. She showed it to me. \n\"Looks the same,\" she said, bored. \nI considered walking out. Maybe I should have.

That's right, to open their email account when you sent the document to print they charge you $3.00. This is in 2019. Also - for notary signature - $10.00. In most other notary places in Nashville the charge is $3.00-5.00. On top of it the guy does not have the hard rubber stamp that imprints itself in the document - this is required for international documents. He just tells you \"It's OK, it's OK\".

{"text":"Terrible customer service, visit another store (I've always had positive experiences at the Palm Harbor location).\n\nI called ahead inquiring about scanning services.  I proactively confirmed with the male associate on the phone the time the store was to close, 6:30pm.  I also set the expectation that I had about 200 pages to scan.  He said okay and that it wouldn't be a problem.  I arrived within four minutes of my call, and after waiting in line over 6 minutes (while the male associate was helping someone else) a woman, who is turning off lights and music finally returns up front.  She asks how she can help.  I mentioned I called in a few minutes ago about scanning, she rolls her eyes and rudely says \"we're closing.\"  It was well before 630pm, 615pm at this point (after I waited in line several minutes).  I mention I had just called, the male associate confirms, she then snaps \"all of that?  You expect to scan all of that in 5 minutes?\"  Keep in mind it is 15 minutes before they close and they have a high speed commercial machine!  I answer yes.  The woman associate rolls her eyes again, sighs, and then proceeds to tell me Lowell did you being a USB drive with you?\"  I answer no, I didn't, it wasn't suggested on the phone that I do.  The woman associate then proceeds to tell me that \"you can only do 10 pages at a time and will have to pay $3.75 for each group\".  The man on the phone previously stated it was $3.75 per email you are sending to, regardless of the number of pages.  I will never return.  I recommend you visit elsewhere.","stars":1}
{"text":"This store charges outrageous prices. I had a USPS flat rate box that usually ships 1-3 days for $18.95 at the post office. I understand there's a convenience fee for USPS services at this UPS center. HOWEVER, I was told that it would cost me $36 to ship USPS, and only $18 via UPS. So I agreed, but they couldn't use my box. So I agreed to buy another box. I DID NOT EXPECT MY TOTAL TO BE $33 TO SEND MY PACKAGE WHEN I COULD'VE PAID SO MUCH LESS TO JUST GO TO THE POST OFFICE. It also would have arrived faster via USPS. Worst off, they told me how much it would cost AFTER they packed my box in another one of their boxes. YES, the shipping fee was $18. The box and all of the add ons they added? $12 extra.\n\nTrust me, if you want to send a large package, just put the stuff in a USPS flat rate box. Price stays the same regardless of weight, unless you're shipping 70 pounds or something. You KNOW what you're going to pay, it ships fast, AND your box is free. \n\nThis isn't even the first time I had a problem with them. One of my friends sent me his old smartphone since mine broke. They lost the package, had a two week investigation, and I heard nothing about it ever since. UPS customer service is awful. The worst of the worst. \n\nTL;DR - Prices are way more expensive than they should be for the sake of convenience. Only two people working and long lines. Some of the workers are rude. AVOID. Never going back there again.","stars":1}

And when I explained how the address was clearly written and she should not blame it on me for her mistake, she SHOUTED at me saying I was screaming at her and refused to continue the work unless I apologize to her.\n\nWill never use UPS at this location. \nWill warn everyone not to come to this location.","stars":1}

The girl Natasha it says on the receipt started grabbing them , ripped the paper on one of them and taped it sort of.  My husband had mentioned several times the big one was car mats.  The second time he mentioned them out pops a guy from the back to look and then pops back in the back again.  The girl said she would box and ship them later as she was busy even though I had waited for her to finish the customer before me.  I had a really uneasy feeling and should have listened to my gut.  I checked the tracking number later and nowhere to be found.  This information I received from the Philippines where they claim they run UPS now.  Went back today (Monday) , different girl there, gives me several different stories , still can't be found and I am told the girl that waited on us, this is her last week and  she doesn't know it.  Apparently she is being fired.  She gave me a  number for her supervisor.  Called that number, answering machine gives name not UPS.  I left 4 messages.  Just now I did get a call back from the supervisor.  She did locate the package, it was still in the place I mailed it from.  Mary, the supervisor is keeping track of it now.  The original woman that runs this place, MaryAnn is actually very nice and competent, not like the girl we got Saturday.  I'm hoping nothing was stolen since I had 13 packages wrapped.  Mary did offer if I wanted to go back and have them undone to see if everything is there but Idecided to wait till it gets to the other end.  Well, it finally arrived yesterday after 4.   I went over everything with my friend, seems there are four items missing.  I left a message for the supervisor last night.  Haven't heard from her.  So I am updating this review in the hopes of hearing from her since that seems to be the only time I do.  I  wonder what hoops I will need to jump through to get this taken care of of or if it ever will be.  Now I  need to spend even more to replace the items stolen.  Stay away from this place unless you want to spend a small fortune and find out what you send gets stolen.

NEVER EVER AGAIN WILL I USE Update- guess I shouldn't hold my breath.  Jumping through hoops trying to get my refund, can't get a hold of a person, no one answers the phone, always have to leave a message.  I've already spent more than I originally did for some of the same items that were stolen.  And when I do ship these out of course I have to pay for that again.  All this after talking to the store owner.  Guess it is a problem no matter who you deal with at ups.  They suck big time!  Just got off the phone with the manager.  She claims they closed the case cause instructions weren't followed.  This after they most certainly were followed.  She said the case was closed but she would reopen and start all over again. Oh, and of course she now claims she hasn't been able to get into her email for 4 days now.  I went to the store and forwarded everything we got to her email in FRONT of her!  To Natasha, the girl no longer working there, but randomly took 4 packages along with her male friend she had in the back room whom shouldn't have been there I wish you Karma, you thief!!!

Customer service is not high on the priority list at this location.\n\nNeedless to say, due to this facility rejecting delivery of my package (which was a very small Amazon box), I was forced to redirect to the location at 17th and Market.  The UPS facility on Oregon mentioned that they've had numerous problems delivering packages to the 1229 Chestnut location in the past.  As a result, my package is still in delivery limbo and is likely sitting at the Oregon facility with no updates in about a week.  I'd be very hesitant before assuming you can redirect a package to this location for pickup.","stars":1}

I came in at 6:35pm with legal documents that had to be delivered the next day. The 2 employees working were closing up the shelves and preparing to leave. I asked when they closed and they said at 7pm! (25 minutes from then and already closing things up!) I made the comment that I was glad to get there in time because I had to send this overnight PKG. They took the PKG and gave me a receipt. The following day the documents didn't show up. When I went back to the store the employee simply said that when I dropped it off, the truck had already picked up for the night! I asked why he didn't tell me that the night before and he just stared at me! This was something that we just going about 20 miles away so had I known it wouldn't be delivered I could've taken it myself! He finally got the owner on the phone for me and his only response was that UPS picks up by 6:30 everywhere so there was no way to have it delivered overnight! I said there was no signs posted to that effect and I was not told by his employees that the truck had already gone. He did not care and said everyone knows 6:30 is the last pick up!! Apparently everyone but me??!! I will NEVER return to this store and I highly recommend people take their business elsewhere!!

I packed up my box and I went back inside and told him I will never ship something from the store again. I'd rather give my mail to the Postal Service than be told I have to go outside of the store to fill the contents. Their reasoning was that they offered services of packing for me. Now the store will lose a lot more than a packing fee as I took my box with me and left and will not go back again. I have multiple children that will need things sent to them to college and I refuse to use this location, or any other location UPS to mail packages.

{"text":"I have been going to this store for a decade. Never have I had such an issue as yesterday. Unfortunately I am unable to wear a mask, and usually this place has accommodated me, for which I am grateful. It's hard having a disability right now; it's actually scary going out sometimes because people can be presumptuous and downright mean. I can deal with mean, but aggressive is another story. \n\nThe two workers in this store were aggressive and the male worker took it way too far. After being yelled at I explained that I was unable to wear a face covering and just wanted to make a quick transaction. I was aggressively told they cannot help me, the male worker then crossed paths with me, so I followed him out of the store, stating he was being discriminatory and that the mask mandate makes exception for people like me. He said he didn't care, told me to leave, then gave me the name \"John Smith\" when I asked. If he was correct in his treatment of me, why would he give me a fake name? What are you so scared of John Smith? \n\nSo I would NEVER have a problem leaving if simply asked. In fact I have done that in other places without a problem. I respect others space. But they were so unbelievably rude and disgusting, I will never go back to this location and let others know as well. You cannot treat people like that. Shame on them both. \n\nI called the store in Hatfield just up the road and they said they could accommodate me, and quickly took my packages while being very kind and understanding about my situation. Stay away from the Cowpath store, and go to Hatfield. \n\nEDITED TO UPDATE BASED ON RESPONSE: I never threatened to sue and I never yelled. I was NOT AT ALL politely asked to leave, nor informed an accommodation could be made for me curbside. That would have been appropriate and I would have been happy to leave then. Instead I was shouted out of the store. \n\nUnbelievable that you would reply to my review like this instead of trying to make it better. Shame on you. You owe me an apology for the treatment I received. Additionally, at other stores I have been treated with kindness and compassion. Not one other store has shouted me out and degraded me as a human being like this one. Most allow me to shop because I am respectful and keep my distance. Again shame on you for your treatment of me. I remained calm the entire time and was harassed by your employees. Disappointed that you actually wrote lies about my behavior.

The older African American female employee then stated she had to reach out to her daughter ,the owner,  to see if she could notarize the documents. She explained to me she was not able to because the location had in the past has issues with fraudulent documents and that they didn't want to assume the risk.  \n   My issue is I feel like you just told me I was fraud. Then denied me a service that you offer that is actually on the window clings at your location. It is my understanding that if you notarize you notarize and it's not at the discretion of the staff nor based on the customer's physical attributes, your intuition,  or race. \n    Needless to say I remained professional and just left with a bad taste in my mouth and felt discriminated against by someone of the same race.  Fast forward to the next day. I went to the location on Market St. across from the Comcast Center less than 2 miles away from that location where that  not only aided in printing out the documents,  they notarized them, packaged for overnight and shipped for me to meet the tight deadline I had. In the future although the Girard  location is literally two blocks from my home I refuse to patronize them same way they discriminated against me and basically told me I was fraud when I was just trying to resolve and close a painful and emotional chapter in my life.

Another cashier ( a young girl) came to ring me up, so I just paid the $18. It was a stapler sitting on the counter behind the register I held the papers up and ask the cashier could she staple them for me please and she said \"NO\" ignorantly and than let me know, it's one over there on the wall, stating \"It's other customers in line.\" Both of the cashier was really ignorant, they are lucky we are in the mist of Covid 19, because I would had took that mask off on gave them both a piece of my mind.

{"text":"I have been to this UPS before but not with this girl at the counter.  Saturday I attempted to mail 13 late Christmas gifts that needed to be boxed and shipped.  The girl Natasha it says on the receipt started grabbing them , ripped the paper on one of them and taped it sort of.  My husband had mentioned several times the big one was car mats.  The second time he mentioned them out pops a guy from the back to look and then pops back in the back again.  The girl said she would box and ship them later as she was busy even though I had waited for her to finish the customer before me.  I had a really uneasy feeling and should have listened to my gut.  I checked the tracking number later and nowhere to be found.  This information I received from the Philippines where they claim they run UPS now.  Went back today (Monday) , different girl there, gives me several different stories , still can't be found and I am told the girl that waited on us, this is her last week and  she doesn't know it.  Apparently she is being fired.  She gave me a  number for her supervisor.  Called that number, answering machine gives name not UPS.  I left 4 messages.  Just now I did get a call back from the supervisor.  She did locate the package, it was still in the place I mailed it from.  Mary, the supervisor is keeping track of it now.  The original woman that runs this place, MaryAnn is actually very nice and competent, not like the girl we got Saturday.  I'm hoping nothing was stolen since I had 13 packages wrapped.  Mary did offer if I wanted to go back and have them undone to see if everything is there but I decided to wait till it gets to the other end.  Well, now let me add to this.  I checked the tracking number and it says a label was created at 6:03 pm tonight.  It still has NOT SHIPPED!!  So much for the supervisor keeping an eye  on it.  3 days it still sits at this place.  This is what you get for $75.00.  This is ludicrous!  I am so angry I can't see straight.  This place does not even deserve 1 star but there is no option for zero stars.  I will NEVER EVER use UPS again.  I  thought from the conversation I had with the supervisor today it was at least ready  to go but NO, my package still sits at this place for what is now the 3rd day.  INSANE!!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"I've visited this UPS location on 2 separate occasions to mail packages that I already had the shipping label for. On both occasions my package never made it to it's destination. The first time, I thought it was just a coincidence which is why I took the chance to use the location again. When contacting the location they didn't seem very concerned with my issue which is why I requested an investigation. The items I dropped off were 2 exclusive sneakers that are worth well over $1000. The shipping label stated they were going to StockX which is known for exchanging such goods which leads me to believe my packages were being stolen on purpose. As mentioned, the first time my items went missing I thought it was just a coincidence and gave the location the benefit of doubt and tried shipping from them again because it's the location closest to my house. I received a drop off receipt on both occasions with a tracking number for both. Neither item left the facility and made it to a truck. I was told when I called about the second missing package that I had missed the cut off time for that day so to check back the next day. The next day I spoke with a manager and he told me he would file a claim to try and report the situation. I've tried following up multiple times and haven't received any correspondence. At this point, this location/ups owes me for my hardship. I won't be able to repurchase these items because they were exclusive. I also want to make other individuals aware of what's going on and to steer away from using this particular location.","stars":1}

Once I was on crutches and got all the way to the door to drop off and realized I didn't have my mask.  They were promptly at the door to tell me I couldn't come in without the mask but refused to take my pkg from my hands that was just a drop off.   The next time I came in they proceeded to argue with me that they scanned all my return codes when I still had products left to be returned.   I had to come back to the store to show them again that they still needed to scan one more code.  No apology.    I will not return here.  I'll go out of my way to get to another store.","stars":1}

They recently moved, but once I found out about the new location, I've been making regular visits.  \n\nThe level of service and convenience is great.  And in my experience, it seems they appreciate you, if you're a regular customer.  \n\nI do wish all of the staff were better about wearing masks.

I'd rather just take a drive a couple miles to Kinkos. \n\nI'm giving two stars because I am sure they serve other people's needs for mailboxes and mailing stuff fine.  But if I ever need a mailbox or need to mail something I'll go elsewhere. I fully believe you should take your money elsewhere too.","stars":2}

{"text":"The man and woman who apparently run the store were exceptionally rude. Initially, they did such a fine job of ignoring me as they packed up boxes on the customer side of the counter that I thought they were also waiting for help.\n\nBefore I realized they worked there, I picked up a tape gun, which was sitting out on one of the tables right in the middle of the store. The man actually yelled: \"No!\" I said, \"Sorry, are you using this?\" He just yelled, \"No!\" again. So I picked up the tape. The woman, who hadn't even looked in my direction up until that point, suddenly looked like she was about to tackle me as she walked up, snatched the tape away, and said, \"You have to pay for tape!\"\n\nAlthough it's ridiculous that they leave packing tape out on a table in the middle of the store but won't allow you to use a single strip, I would have agreed to purchase some tape if they had been the slightest bit polite about it. The whole thing would have been comical had I not been in a hurry. Naturally, I wasn't about to give them my business. So I had to find another location. That didn't seem to concern them. I guess they would rather unsuccessfully try to sell tape than successfully ship a package.\n\nUse the FedEx store across the street and one block east. Polite personnel and the store itself is much cleaner.","stars":1}

{"text":"This review has been a long time coming. I had a package \"delivered\" back in November of last year. When I arrived, my package could not be found. Everyone was super friendly and assured me they would figure out what happened. I received a call the next day where they said they accidentally placed my package in someone else's P.O. Box but it was on the way back and they would call me when it arrived. I never received a phone call. From that moment on, whenever I called, it seemed like an annoyance to them; \"we'll call you when it's here.\" \"The manager in charge of that isn't here, she'll call you back.\" (Nobody ever followed up) This happened for a month a half. Nobody bothered telling me that I could file a claim. When I finally realized my package wasn't coming, I started the claim process and by then it was too late because I had exceeded the 30 days. I understand people make mistakes but what annoys me is that 1. I was led on about my package being on route 2. I was never told to file a claim. Because of all of this I lost out on my package and the money I had spent on it. The reason I didn't write a review until now was because I barely got the issue \"resolved\" (by resolved, I mean the company just said \"no\" to issuing a refund) it's been MONTHS of having to email UPS and the company I purchased from. Filing claims, having to email to check up, replying to everyone, showing proof.","stars":1}

We had to call around and find our package. When we found out the package was being held, it was the last day we could pick it up before it was sent back to the sender. Once we arrived at the store we were treated like criminals trying to steal a package. The staff barked at my husband for his ID. \n\nMy family will never return to this UPS again.

There was only one other customer in the store yet all they wanted to do is get the \"problem customer\" out of the store. They said extensive delays are common right now.

He wasn't involved at all but he reiterated, 'Sir, we just try and handle things as quickly as we can.'  \n\nA customer  overheard and said something positive about the service in the store.  I agreed with her and said that's why I'm here frequently.  \n\nScott(I think that was his name) then repeated what he'd already said to me, this time with a different tone.   I said, 'I heard you the first time.'  Then asked if there was a problem with me asking a question.  By this time there were no customers behind me.  'Scott' seemed really flustered.  \n\nI was in the store for under 10 minutes total but two of the UPS guys made it a little unpleasant.

{"text":"I had time sensitive governement international documents that had to be sent put today with very specific instructions.  The first person I spoke to regarding my shipping needs quickly responded, \"When don't do that.\" When I looked shocked he then said \"fine ok we do so that.\" I filled out a form for one label. they did not give me a form for the second (return label). I stayed verbally and showed them the written instructions in my hand from the USDA staying the directions regarding the return label indicating that both send and recipient must be my address and theirs shouldn't be included. The man said \"that's fine.\" He gave me oprions for deliver and i chose Next Day Early Air Am (8:00am)   He then printed off the first label.  I told him *again * that the return label has to have my address for sende r and recipient and not the IDEA address per their imstruction. I said the return label just needs to be Next Day Air, not early am.  He said, \"yeah I know mam.\" He then printed off label with the wrong sender address, and for 2day delivery. I said no and reexplained the address requirememts amd showed him the written instructions. I also said it needs to be next fay as well. He said 2day was cheapest and I said this is time sensituve and it needed to be Next Day. He then said it was my fault because I told him wrong even though I read three times directly from the written imstructions.   He then printed another  label with the wrong sender address. When I corrected it and showed him the directions again in writing he got mad and said he couldn't deal with it and asked another lady to take over. She said \"what is,your problem m am? \" I said the USDA is very particular and I just need the return label to not include their address. I showed her the written USDA directions. She rolled her eyes, cut me off midsentenceand said \"okokok I got it just stop.\" She asked me when I wanted it, 2 day or next day. I told her Next Day Air but not am. She yelled at me for saying not am. Then she reprocessed the outgoing label and I said that one has to be NEXT DAY EARLY AM (8:00am).  She said \"mam there is only 2day or next day there is no early next day.\" and I said that he just told me there was and it was $30 next day and $68 next day am 8:00am. She said \"God fine.\" then she printed it out. I said I do not need a return envelope the USDA has see I died in the instructions not to include one. what does she do? she immediately puts the Return labe l on an envelope and begins to include it in package.  I told her and showed her the specif USDA instructions that state not to d o that. SHE YELLED AT ME. She said \"I wish u woulda said that already man. I already did this. you are getting on my last nerves is there anything else??\"  I did not reply. She then in fit of rage ripped up the return package she messed up on and printed out a new label going off on me the entire time while I said nothing. THEN she started to package it for shipmentand I asked to see the return label just to make sure. She yelled at me. She said \"WHY WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT. YOU ARE GETTING ON MY LAST NERVES.   ALL I DID WAS REPRINT IT.\" I calmly responded that these documents were extremely important , USDA is very particular and I just needed to double check.  SHE kept mumbling how terrible I was. By that point I lost complete faith my package would be delivered safely. While she continued to mumble i asked her if I should go to another ups. She said \"I don't care what the hell you do.\"  I said ok.  I also let her know this unprofessional was recorded on my phone and that's I'd be sharing it with management and others. She told me that she \"hoped I fall on my way out the door.\"  I her unprofessional and uncalled for behavior recorded.  I went to the UPS off airline and had zero trouble. They were super fast and helpful.  This place berated me and wished me physical harm all over a return label and the particulars of USDA requirements.

I had carried in three items, and went back to my car for the other three. When I came back in, I asked if he had figured out what to do with the shipping sheets, which are supposed to go to the driver. He flipped one of my packages and showed me where he had attached the entire sheet to one of the packages (all have different location destinations) and said \"I just did this. We get 1000s of these a month, and I have no idea what to do with them.\" Bro, that is literally your job.

My picture was on the license.  I also had additional picture identification which he rejected. My experience was compounded by the fact that these documents are time sensitive.  He was unwilling to review additional documents with my official signature. I would suggest if you need anything notarized DO NOT GO HERE!\n\n\nIn response to your response to my Yelp comments. If you look at the video tape then when we entered your store the sale clerk asked what we were here for, we politely said to have some documents notarized. She jumped at us and said you have to have an appointment! All we did was respond and said we have an appointment. At 4 o'clock. And she said oh I'm sorry then she stepped over to tell you that we were here.  Y'all chatted for a while you continue to put some type of bubble wrap in a box, tape it, and generally ignore us while doing menial work wasting our time. Instead of stopping putting bubble wrap into a box and returning to that task after you had taken care of a waiting customer, you continued - as we waited patiently even though we could clearly see that what you were doing was not urgent. You decided to be rude. So let's get the video tape and compare notes sir. You were rude! You had me sign my documents, all three of them, not just one and then you told me the signatures do not match! The documents that I was signing with my left hand were affidavits to an injury to my left hand!  Of course I would not be able to sign exactly since my left hand has been damaged! And as I reiterated, the signature on my drivers license is distorted and shrunk considerably. Also, if you look at the video tape you will notice that you flippantly tossed my license back at me and said you would not notarize these when we ask why you said the signature did not match. We offered additional verification with photo and signatures but you refuse to look at them, you walked away behind your pillar, instead of engaging us and explaining why you would not except additional photo/signature IDs. So let's not go to your video unless you want a full viewing of how rude you and your staff are!  So your statement about being hauled into court are unfounded, since I was the person mentioned in the affidavits, that was me in your store, and that was my signature!  So why would you be hauled into court for notarizing a false signature?  You're actions are a reflection of the company you represent. And I notice your rating continues to fall.

They are like math prodigy that can dictate how much the shipping cost without even looking at the address and see how heavy it is! That is so miracle! Secondly, I don't think they understand their policy I showed up with a return label and they told me Oh we couldn't return a perfume that even was previously shipped by UPS, you need a permit. I got a return label from the permitted store, why can't I ship it back? He told me to go to the South Oregon store and when I called UPS customer service she told me I totally could drop off everywhere. Honestly, just like lots of my friends, the only reason I came to this store is because there is no other store on campus that you can go to! They were also very rude in the way they forcefully asked me to moved away from the counter to fill out the form. If someone don't love their job they should totally quit it rather than keeping staying in there to ruin the reputation of such a big company like UPS.","stars":1}

When I called the store the person who answered the call was absolutely horrible from a customer service perspective.   The person that \"SOLD\" me the overnight NEVER mentioned it wouldn't get there actually he even said and I quote \"this will arrive by 10:30am tomorrow morning.\"   It was a Birthday Cake for my son in college, I decided it would be a great surprise to send it to him, wrapped it so it wouldn't move and wouldn't be destroyed, packed it with dry ice, which made it heavier and paid the $80 to ship it.    When I called the woman who was no help what so-ever said they have a sign next to the register.   If you go into this place there are boxes ALL OVER THE PLACE, the sign is a postage stamp and basically looks like a printed page.     So, I repeat do not fall for what I did, do not SHIP WITH UPS!!!! Remember these companies need us because they dont make ANY money shipping Amazon, they make up their costs by screwing the consumer, so if we stop using them they have to change!","stars":1}

{"text":"I recently shipped a hand made item to raise money for a family who lost a service member in combat in Afghanistan. The owner of the UPS Des Peres store accepted the item, wrapped it and shipped it.  When it arrived the item was destroyed.  I had taken out $500 insurance on the item.  It was devastating.  I went back to the store and the owner would not honor the insurance claim.  He knew what this item was for yet he said he was not liable.  I had luckily saved my receipt and started up the chain with UPS.  I discovered each location is locally owned.  I turned in my claim to the Company UPS who discovered the packing did not follow UPS packing guidelines and the store owner was liable.  Upon presenting him with the new information he again declined  I continued with UPS, the main Company, and found Company representatives in Salt Lake City who agreed to honor my claim. Apparently the copy of the shipping agreement the owner had was different than mine.  He claimed he had written on my receipt he couldn't promise the package would arrive safely. He also is not suppose to ship any hand made art.  Amazingly he said he didn't know that.  I paid him $90 to ship my item only to have it destroyed.  UPS sent me a check for the insurance claim and the entire amount was donated to the Navy Seal Foundation in honor of the service man who gave his life.  Go somewhere else to ship your items. If you use this store save your receipt. Although it just might not be the same receipt the owner has.  I feel this individual has zero moral fiber and is not worthy of your business.

Too bad, they will put one piece of tape and charge you $1 it. Already brought your own packaging gear? Too bad, they'll stick yours into their own WITHOUT warning and charge you for it, and claim it's because yours isn't good enough. Question their services and ask why? They will YELL at you, accuse you of not listening, and THROW your package while they snarl at you in a foreign language.\n\nWhy does this place have such high reviews? Probably because the majority of the positive reviews for this place come from people who have 0-1 friends.... questionable? \n\nNEED to go to UPS?

The lady at the store, shame on my for not remembering her name, was incredibly helpful, patient, and wouldn't even let me pay for the copies I made.  FishHawk is a wonderful community.  It seems like a place where small businesses that provide great customer service would be appreciated.  I found this store to be a wonderful addition to the area.

{"text":"Usually pretty quick but a bit expensive.\n\nI've had two major experiences with the UPS Store - printing the Top 50 Places to Eat certificates and mailing them.\n\nTo print the certificates I had to use their computer to log on to my email and print to their printer. Of course, me being me I forgot my passwords. Basically ten minutes later and a lot of macgyvering from my phone and I was in! The next major issue was their printer wouldn't print! One of their printers prints a weird red, needed it to be the official Yelp color, so that was out. The other wasn't connecting to the computer. In the end the woman put my certificates on a flash drive and took it to the back to print them out. She messed up and printed a couple times so she handed me a stack of card stock to make up for the extra that printed on my paper. This took about another ten minutes of figuring out the printer. After all that the total came to $4.82. I was in shock that it is that inexpensive to print things! The certificates are basically all red so that was a lot of ink. I walked out of there 20 minutes poorer but feeling pretty rich monetarily.\n\nNext experience, I had to mail the certificates. Since I didn't want to fold them they went into a paper sized envelope with a card. The employee weighed it and to mail 49 certificates it was $98. I had already hand delivered one. This time the cost shocked me the other way. Wow that was expensive. I'm now super curious what the cost would be to mail it at USPS. \n\nThere is sometimes a line but that is usually about 4 p.m. onwards when people are getting off of work. \n\nThis is a super convenient store for me since it is right next to my Publix, but if I want to save money I'd go to USPS.

Clearly, you are sick of telling people not to cut through. The smart solution is posting a sign. I watched you get rude with other customers as I waited in line to check out. I reported you to Dierberg's management and they were not surprised and shared the same sentiment, in fact, they referred to you in a manner that I'll just leave to your own imagination.","stars":1}

But when you are the first person who  walks into the store with a smile on their face. You should at least be greeted with the same courtesy. Maybe a hello, smirk and not feel as if needing their assistance was like pulling teeth.I didn't know that printing out some Super Bowl signs 8x10 would be too much for them to endure.\n\nI have decided I will drive over to Plumb and Arlington now for future UPS transitions.

I went home and got the proper labels to attach and returned the next day.  Two different people were working and the service was decent.  I was walking out the door when I thought, I need to say something.  Returned and spoke with someone, told her about the bad customer service.  Turns out it was her husband that I dealt with.  So here's a positive and a negative.  She told me she'd take care of the problem (it's her husband, what will happen) and she also said next time I come in to deal only with her.

And there was no guarantee my mail wouldn't been taken by the mail man or lost. The only thing he could do was have someone sign for it on arrival. Then he asked if it was something that could be insured because that was the only recourse if things are lost or taken. I told him they were death papers and obvious I wouldn't want them stolen and he said you couldn't insure that but it's ok because you can get them made again.   Very bad attitude about the whole thing and very upsetting to think no one can guarantee anything in mail is safe. I wish maybe I went to fedex. Not sure that would be different.

{"text":"I have used this UPS on S. MacDill many times over the last 12 plus years as it is close by and parking is never an issue. If I had to wish one thing it is that they plant oak trees (maybe live oaks as they live forever/hardy) around the edges of the parking lot and in the parking lot to provide more shade and beautify what is basically a strip mall/best time to do that would be during rainy season starting in May.\n\nPros\n1) I am not that old yet (do have white/gray hair) but have had carpel tunnel surgery on both hands and now cubical tunnel syndrome in one hand (PAINFUL). I can still carry my own boxes inside 99% of the time but twice in the last 3 years, my hand really hurt and a young man inside UPS carried my box inside.\n\n2) OK so UPS prices have increased - so has inflation, gasoline, rent, etc. Use the US post office next time and their prices went up also (while giving Amazon.com a steep discount on shipping) and charging Amazon company competitors and all USA taxpayer customers higher shipping prices and a price hike each year.   Oh..and FYI, ALL USA taxpayers pay for Chinese products to be shipped to the USA for free because China is considered an evolving country.\n\n3) UPS has never lost a package and I rarely pay for insurance. When I lived in TX, FedEx lost an expensive package in Dallas TX (hub) stolen by gangs operating at that facility according to Fed Ex themselves and the gangs just click computer keys saying the package was forwarded to Abilene (or wherever) when it was never sent - but stolen in their Dallas hub. I never used Fed Ex again and never will. UPS all the way.\n\n4) I have personally never experienced a rude customer service person at the UPS S. MacDill Rd location. The UPS store on MacDill AFB does have the occasional rude clerk which is why I don't use them as much even though they are closer.\n\n5) The UPS on South MacDill Rd usually has 2-3 people working inside when I go in and one of them will immediately go to the counter when I walk in. Unlike the MacDill AFB UPS store which has 2 people working there and several times I had to stand around scratching my butt (sarcasm) and wait for one of them to get around to walking up to the counter to help me.\nI would rather drive a bit longer to the S. MacDill UPS and get in and out quickly with no rude clerks than go to the MacDill AFB UPS.  \n\n6) Their prices to send a fax are high but with so many free fax facilities on-line why pay UPS or anyone else. I do not.   \n\n7) There is rarely a line so I am in and out of the building quickly. Even when Covid first hit and I had to wait outside the S. MacDill Road UPS as only like 2 customers or so could be inside at a time and sometimes a husband/wife would be inside taking up 1 customer slot but I didn't mind...at least I could go inside UPS eventually (ahhh lovely air conditioning) and the people at the register are quick. UPS was nothing like that God awful South Dale Mabre Sherwin Williams paint store during Covid at its worst where the douchebag Sherwin Williams clerks locked the doors and made everyone stay permanently outside IN THE SUN and call on your cell to them inside to place your order, and give your credit card number over the phone outside in the parking lot where other customers could hear you (and hear your credit card number) and then wait around in the boiling hot parking lot for Sherwin WIlliam clerks to \"get around\" to bringing your paint/brushes or whatever outside to your vehicle. Sherwin WIlliam's store has a glass front so boiling hot customers in the parking lot and connected just as hot sidewalk could see the clerks inside ignoring your calls, goofing off inside and taking their time filling your order and/or bringing your stuff outside to your vehicle.\n\nI have to go to UPS on S. MacDill Rd soon to to drop off 2 boxes. I expect my experience will be like all the other visits ....excellent.","stars":5}

A package shipped from London to be delivered to my home was rerouted to this UPS location in Reno, NV.  After much time wasted with UPS, I called the local franchise and was so fortunate that Lynne answered the phone.  \n\nFor a week - almost every.single.day - Lynne called UPS to track my package as it floated around the country.  It was finally shipped last week to a main hub in Los Angeles.  If it weren't for Lynne and her amazing tenacity and detective work, I would have never been able to retrieve my package as the today was the last day for pick up.  Unfortunately, NONE of this was posted on the UPS dashboard, only Lynne was able to discover this information and pass it along to me.\n\nBottom line, please use this location.  The folks here were friendly, helpful, and pleasant every time I called.  Lynne is exceptional!  If you have a package issue, she is the UPS whisperer.

I am from out of town and ship a lot of packages for my online business when I'm traveling so I originally went to the UPS store on sixth Street in Tucson right when I walked in the lady asked if they all had labels and told me to leave them on the counter but when I asked her for a receipt for all of the packages she said they don't give Receipts. I went back-and-forth with her for a while but she refused to give me a receipt which is absolutely shady. (And she was the OWNER).Why would I leave thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with you without having some record that you are now in possession of it? So I took all of my items and opted to go to a different UPS store because I've never had an experience like that at a UPS store in the past. When I walked into this Broadway location I was immediately greeted in a friendly manner! They immediately started scanning my packages without me asking and when I asked for a receipt they said sure of course! The kind associate name who helped me name was Destiny!

{"text":"We've been using this UPS store for several years (first when they were located a few doors down from Publix and now in their new location just around the corner in the business complex).  Listen, it's a UPS store, so their purpose and services are pretty straight-forward, and they do a decent job.  The variable in this equation, and many of the Yelp reviews support this, is customer service.\n\nMost of my visits involve simply dropping off a pre-paid package; I would suggest that they (the manger, particularly) recognize me, as I recognize them, having been a customer for more than 5 years - with a significant increase in visits as we work more frequently from home.\n\nHere is what is infuriating: standing in line behind a certified MUPPET who has all kinds of inane questions (but is making no purchase) - when all you want to do is drop something off! (i.e. NO register, NO paperwork).  So the other day, this lady walks in the door quickly in front of me (man, I knew this was gonna be painful, I just knew it...) and goes to the counter.  NOT to make a purchase.  NOT to mail a package.  BUT to spend the next 10 friggin minutes asking about various prices to send a POTENTIAL package to Riga.  Now, here is where it got fun.  Riga is the capital of Latvia, a small country on the Baltic sea in Eastern Europe.  I don't expect everyone to know that.  But I DO EXPECT THE CUSTOMER to know that!!!!  The lady helping her had to Google it.  Meanwhile, other staff milled in the back, and the line behind me grew to 3 - then dwindled to 2 when the last person in line gave up. \n\nSo, after this enchanting 10 minute exchange - during which NOTHING was purchased, I was finally able to approach the counter and simply drop off my pre-paid package.  \n\nListen: please look UP and be aware of your customers.  Take care of folks who have actual business!  No need to be rude to Riga lady - but do tell her and those like her- hey, let me take care of these customers, and I will be right back with you.\n\nFor the record, I would say 50% of the time I go there to drop off packages, I am in a very similar situation.\n\nALSO - it is NOT CLOSED - it is now located in the complex BEHIND FROYO/ Mothers - across for a medical office.","stars":3}

{"text":"Great place for everything! I especially love the fact that this is an Amazon drop spot- I can return my items unwrapped and unboxed and they ship it back. It makes buying and returning from Amazon so much easier. I have also used this UPS Store for faxing documents and all around mailing. They are professional and courteous.","stars":5}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location again. I believe it has changed management and the new person is extremely rude and condesending.

{"text":"If I could give this UPS store zero stars, I would based on the sheer rudeness and lack of respect and unprofessionalism. The elderly man behind the counter looked irritated as my husband tried to enter the Dierberg store instead of waiting in line with me. My husband is a doctor, but was dressed in a hoodie and baseball cap. The man yelled in a rude tone in front of the other customers, \"If you would've seen the sign, it will tell you that you can't go through there.\" Mind you the sign was on a small piece of paper and not easily readable from across the large store. Then, after my husband left, that same man was even more rude to me. I mentioned that Amazon said to bring the items to return without placing them in bags or boxes. He ordered me to place my items to return to Amazon in bags on the counter. Then, spat \"I'm not touching that; we're in the midst of a pandemic!\" I can't believe the way he spoke to me in front of my daughter. I was nothing but respectful and never gave him any reason to be yelled at or talked down to. I have seen and read the comments that the owner of this store wrote in response to the multiple complains on Google. Not once has he apologized or done anything to alleviate the situation that the patrons have complained about. Instead, he placed the blame upon the customer.  If you see all the complaints on Yelp, Google, and other sites, you will see this is not an isolated incident, but a trend of unprofessionalism.","stars":1}
{"text":"Worthless - I had a 9am appointment at this store (confirmed through email) to get something notarized.  At 9:20 am, the doors were still locked and no one was inside the store.  Quite a few people came and went with packages to mail, frustrated the store wasn't opened at the time the sign on the door and their voicemail said.","stars":1}

He never once asked how could he help or my reason for the visit. I stood to the side to wait for him to acknowledge I was standing there. But, he never looked up. So, I walked up to the computer and told why I was there. He still continued to look down. He finally looks up says I thought you were talking to yourself. He is the rudest person I have ever encountered on my life. I will never return to this location nor will I recommend this place. I love how the person replying to the reviews won't take blame for his actions. I have talked to several people about this location and the all have said the man who runs it is rude. But I guess we are all frustrated lol..","stars":1}
{"text":"Finally a location with customer service, tact and expertise. After a rough experience at the Lemmon Valley #4252 location telling me a 3rd party QR code was not for a UPS tracking number location although as seen attached it clearly was- I drove a half hour to this location. The gentleman at the counter scanned the QR code, printed and affixed the shipping label and handed me a receipt in a matter of seconds. \n\nHe not knowing what I just went through with a rude owner Sam at another location - was nothing but polite. All three staff members at the counter were all there with an excellent attitude and willingness to help. I thanked him for doing it so quickly and easily and explained my experience at another location who told me it wasn't for UPS even though I set it up as a UPS ground shipment through the 3rd party Mercari app. He said it was actually really basic and anyone should've been able to do it. That he was sorry to hear that the other guy was so rude, when clearly it was indeed for UPS. \n\nThank you all for your knowledge in processing QR codes for mailing labels. Thank you for the positive friendly demeanor as well - it was well worth the drive and I immensely appreciate your time. It turned my off day around!","stars":5}

The woman at the counter told him he needed to tape the shipping envelope shut.  He said he did not understand her (strong accent).  She repeated it several times to the poor man who still didn't understand her.  She told him it was one dollar (for her to tape it).  He got out a dollar a little puzzled and she said no no. I won't charge you now but next time if I have to tape it closed, it will be a dollar.  He then shuffled out the door.  I was so angry at myself for not speaking up.  A World War Two vet and she was giving him grief over a piece of GD tape.  She should be ashamed of herself and the business should do better recognizing those who fought for our freedom.","stars":2}

{"text":"I recently won a small painting encased in a wood frame shipped via the Collegeville UPS store. Never again! I had a bad premonition when the package arrived and I heard rattling from inside. The item was a small oil painting on a lightweight board with a handsome wood frame. The painting had been seperated from the frame -- who knows why? -- and was left unwrapped and unsecured in any way so it could freely move to bang against the wood frame (also with no wrapping). That was sadly the rattling sound from within -- the precious painting slamming against the wood frame. How much labor would it take to wrap up a 5X6 inch lightweight board???  The painting was left with no protection at all, no wrapping, separated from its frame so it could slam against it. I highly encourage anyone who ships a valued item to avoid this store.","stars":1}

He said well I have to charge you $1 a piece for each piece of tape...or you can buy a roll of tape and just take it with you. I thought he was kidding and I saw that he wasn't. Really I asked? He said he is constantly asked all day long for just one piece of tape and it adds up. I paid it and left my packages but in hind-sight I wished I would have said no thanks. I thought about shipping him a box full of shipping tape so he can quit charging people for one piece of tape. (If I had no packing materials or four sides of a box needed taping I would understand. I needed a piece of tape about 4\" long on each box.) \nI prefer friendly customer service.","stars":1}

{"text":"Unfortunately I can't recommend using this UPS store for packing and shipping fragile materials. In a previous shipment, I had them pack and ship something to send to a family member with a fragile item in it. They put some airbags in the box and called it a day, and the item showed up broken. It wasn't super expensive so I wasn't worried about it, but I made a note to pack my own boxes in the future since I know proper packing standards- I worked at a pack and ship store for several years. \n\nToday I went to them again to get some packing peanuts so I could pack the box myself and just turn it over to them for shipping. The lady at the counter said they don't sell packing peanuts. She went on to state that UPS has banned them. She offered me airbags again, which will not work for a truly fragile item. I called the Office Boss store across the street, and they were happy to sell me some peanuts.\n\nIf this store truly doesn't offer appropriate fill or follow best practices in shipping (2 inches around all fragile items) then I cannot recommend that you have them pack your fragile items here. The staff is nice, and their other services are decent, so it pains me to give them a low review, but the packing and shipping aspect really needs some work. Maybe they can look into cornstarch peanuts, which are widely available.","stars":2}

There was an additional sign on the door that stated they'd be opening at 9 AM this week.  Would be nice if they'd update the online information so customers don't have to waste their time like I did.  As I got back in my car, the individual parked next to me who turned out to be an employee just sitting in her car and watching three other customers try the door, doing nothing to explain the delayed hours, unlocked the door and went in.

I have called and been put on hold for over ten minutes where I had to call back 3x having been left on hold and/or hung up on as I waited. Earlier today, I called to find out about yet another missing package, and the gentleman I was speaking to started helping a customer in the store without telling or asking to put me on hold. I was so fed up with the lack of customer service today that I asked for the name of the owner. I was told by the person there whose name I know and will withhold here, that they are not allowed to do that. I will be calling the main UPS number on Monday to file a complaint.","stars":1}
{"text":"Fellow internet shoppers and frequent shippers, DO NOT GO HERE.  I am a practicing attorney who frequently ships items for business and to make returns on purchased goods as I primarily shop online. Similarly to another customer review, my package \"was never scanned by the driver\".  This is the convenient excuse by the manager who is not in any way customer friendly and borderline disrespectful when I called after a valuable package we shipped back to the vendor 3 weeks prior had not arrived at the store.  Not only did it not arrive, the vendor (Net-a-Porter) could see that the pre-paid label had never been scanned as accepted by UPS.  The same information was given to me after speaking with UPS customer care. So apparently my package containing over $1000 of designer clothing just disappeared and according to the electronic record - the only record whatsoever - it never left the store. \n\nFurthermore, it is not good business to tell customers that you are busy and they should leave the package with you and you'll \"take care of it\" without giving a receipt to the customer. This is exactly what occurred when my assistant dropped it off and now the package has disappeared into thin air.  I have never had this experience at any UPS store and am currently researching my legal options to find an appropriate remedy.","stars":1}

{"text":"Sweet baby Jesus they charge a lot.  I'm not kidding when I say they must have the highest notary fee I've ever encountered.  Normally I get documents notarized at Bank of America where I have a checking account; it's FREE.  Most banks are the same.  However, BofA tends to have a five minute line to sit down and get something notarized.  I figured I'd save a few minutes of my time by going to the UPS Store where I frequently ship things as I'd seen the notary sign.  After the hefty 60 seconds of work the person spent signing and stamping my one page document, I get the $10 bill.  Yes, ten dollars for 60 seconds work; simply insane.  I guess I should strive to reach the point where a few minutes of my time is worth more than $10 but I'm not there yet.\n\nPacking fees are excessive as well.  I had two pieces of equipment packed in separate boxes.  They were about 50 pounds each so required thick boxes, and double bubble wrap.  The materials would cost about $8 from Uline if you were buying in typical consumer quantities.  I don't know how much labor was involved, but I came back in 30 minutes and everything was done.  The price you ask?  $70.  Not for shipping, just $70 to package two items in boxes not more than 24x24x12.\n\nIf there's one piece of advice I can offer, it's ask how much something is in advance when you visit this store, because you may be in for a rude awakening.","stars":2}

When she returned to ring me out at the register, my document was printed portrait instead of landscape. When I mentioned it was incorrect and the document should have printed landscape, she told me it wouldn't work that way and I would have to take it home and reformat it.

If I didn't have 2 fussy kids waiting with my mom in the car, I would have stayed and disputed the charge more.

I think the UPS website guarantees that quick print jobs will be done within 24 hours.  Not super convenient for such a small print job but I have been dealing until I find a better alternative.  I happened to use another UPS location (Green Hills) because I had some errands to run close by and they had my job ready for me within an hour.  So then I realized, no, it shouldn't take 24 hours to print 2 sheets of paper.  And this location always uses the whole 24 hours.  Again, totally within what they guarantee so I don't have a ton of room to gripe, but at the same time, it's something that takes 30 seconds to get done.  So I'll just be using another location going forward.  Also, this location always screws up the job in some way - double sided when I ordered single sided, color when I ordered black and white, etc.  The staff is totally nice when I go in, so nothing against them, I would just go somewhere else if you need a small print job done quickly and accurately.","stars":2}

I will never set foot in here again until the ownership of this store has fully transitioned.  The man that everyone is complaining about in the reviews below is most definitely just as horrible as everyone made him out to be.  \n\nI stopped in to just drop off two packages... one for UPS and one for USPS.  Yes, I do realize I'm at the UPS store, but I've also learned within the past two years that UPS also takes USPS mail / packages.  I didn't think this store would be any different... and the tall man that was at the front today with the grey curly hair, glasses, and blue collared shirt was BEYOND the RUDEST person I have EVER come across.  I told this guy that the Manayunk location always takes my USPS items, and he quickly snapped back and said \"WELL WE DON'T. WHY DON'T YOU GO UP THE STREET AND GO TO THE POST OFFICE.\"  I was quick to tell him how rude he was and how there are much better ways to communicate with people.  Faaack you, Mr.  I hate to stoop down to his level, but I was shocked as to how disrespectful and angry he was.  I was so heated from my interaction with him that I walked out of the store with my package and called that UPS store again and asked for the manager --- luckily, a nice young gentleman picked up and said he was the new manager and that they are in the process of transitioning to new ownership... (THANK GOD, clearly, UPS is finally listening).  He told me to go ahead and come back, and I went ahead and told him the story.  He kept apologizing and said he doesn't even know why this guy said that, etc... and that they do take the USPS packages (and he is going to make it a point to do it moving forward).  Very nice guy with good customer service (the way an owner should be!) - I feel so bad for the mess he has to clean up with everyone having such terrible experiences.....\n\nOnce this place has transitioned to the new owner, I'll update my review... but until that scrooge is there, I'm keeping it at 1.","stars":1}

You will SOMETIMES com across problems when shipping over the border but that is something you should expect in the day and age we live in. \n\nThe people here are friendly and try to take care of everything for you as quickly and smoothly as they can. They don't do anything that another place wouldn't do so it isn't above average by any means but it falls in line with the rest.","stars":3}

{"text":"The UPS print team  has done it again!\n\nThis was our second print job that this UPS store (next to Raleys on Wedge Parkway) handled.  The first job was a banner for our trade booth and this one a multi-color folded flyer. Both of these orders turned out beautifully and are of exceptional quality.  Our creative director said that the expertise and knowledge of the staff here was better than any he has dealt with in San Francisco (where his business is located) or online.  I know that the allure of lower online prices for printing can be hard to resist but bring your print jobs here and you'll be hard pressed to justify going anywhere else!","stars":5}

I have always met the same person behind the counter, who seems to operate the USAA machines with ease and knowledge, always good things when handling money.\n\nWhen I have a package to ship via UPS I will go here. I will continue to go here to deposit checks for USAA. \n\nThey have a large supplies of tootsie rolls to boot (you are allowed one per visit).","stars":4}

{"text":"Went here with a coworker to ship a package.  It was a Friday and the sign on the door indicated the store should be open at 8AM.  It was 9AM when we got there, the door was locked, and there were no employees in sight.  Not sure if we missed something?  A little annoyed though we took time out of our workday to come here and had no success in mailing her package.","stars":1}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful, very helpful . I made a mistake and brought a package there instead of the Post Office and the workers were so kind to me and offered to turn it in with their mail pick up so I didn't have to make another trip. They went above and beyond!","stars":4}
{"text":"Like the other reviewer said, it's really not UPS, but an affiliate of UPS...Ma & Pa store.  No corporate support, since they are independently owned.  When my package got sent back due to problems with getting a signature from the receiver, the other UPS store credited this UPS Store (230 N. Maple Ave, Marlton, NJ).  They kept the credit & wanted to charge me for storage!  Funny I told them to re-ship it, but they did nothing.  Finally I picked it up and I'm out $25 and 6+ phone calls to UPS'.  Save yourself the misery and stay away from this location due to poor customer service/management.","stars":1}

{"text":"My go-to spot to have things shipped off. Staff are always nice, fast and professional. This location offers all the things you need to ship any item off from envelopes to boxes. They also provide assistance with packaging various items and providing labels if needed. The store is located in the middle of a shopping center, so the parking can be a little tight at times, but it is usually easy to find a spot if you are willing to make a little walk. Definitely a great place to have your items shipped if you are looking to send something off!","stars":5}

{"text":"This is directed at UPS as a whole. Can I give 0 stars?  Packages are NEVER delivered. EVER. I am home all day, NO call. NO buzz, NO attempt to deliver the package. Although the LAZY driver can somehow still manage to SNEAK up to my door to slap a notice on there....so WHY NOT BRING THE DAMN PACKAGE TOO?!? I can see how a single envelope is a serious burden to lug up to my door.  EVERY TIME it's the same thing.\n Previously, and on more than one occasion, I have received only ONE notice with the THIRD attempt checked off?! I wonder if these drivers get a full days pay even if they finish their \"run\" early?  Must be the case as I have NEVER dealt with such an utterly useless and incredibly inconvenient service. \n\nNow, because these people are ridiculously lazy and incompetent, I must drive across town to pick it up myself. Why even have the bloody truck? Losers. \n\nAVOID UPS at all costs. I would happily pay much more for a service that can actually achieve it's very BASIC duty. \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I HATE UPS!!!!!!!!!! and I guarantee, in fact I'd bet money on it, that you will too.\n\nDONT DO IT. Remember to ask whichever company you order from if they offer ANYONE, other than UPS.\n\n Even a miniature donkey with saddle bags would be preferable and infinitely more reliable.","stars":1}
{"text":"My experience was HORRIBLE. We were mislead about the service they were providing. They did not get the package delivered on time as promised. They charged $39.70 for a package weighing 0.2 lbs. that they actually turned over to Post Office for delivery. The Post Office charges $19.99 to ship that same package. The UPS store employee assured us it would be overnighted that is why we paid the extra money. That did not happen. He sat on the package until late that afternoon when he turned it over to the Post Office.  Proving that even though he lead us to believe it would be sent overnight he had no intentions of doing so.\n\n This matter has gone back & forth for two days. It has involved 2 of the most arrogant UPS store employees (T & C), a 3 way conference call & contact with UPS Store Corp. Today I got a call from the franchisee. She called because I filed a complaint at Corporate and they require their franchisee respond to complaints. She asked nothing about what had gone on the past 2 days. She immediately jumped into her defense mode. Not a clue about customer service. After talking to her all the puzzle pieces fit into to place. She stated that she was not at fault, her employees did nothing wrong and that was pretty much it. Oh and she also said I talked so much no one could get a word in edgewise. Nice reflecting! I told Her that she WAS at fault, her employees were untrained, were lying to customers and good luck staying in business treating customers this way.\nFunny thing is as uninformed as her employees are ( not to mention rude) they are EXACTLY like HER.\n\nHm, just read the other reviews. Seems that I'm not the only one who won't be back.","stars":1}

I have had to ship packages and have documents notarized and I am shocked how quickly I am on my way. The prices can't be beaten either.  I have tried a few notaries in the area and these guys have the best prices. I am truly shocked by the other reviews here. I feel the many satisfied customers don't review on yelp, just the few upset ones.","stars":5}
{"text":"I've got mixed feelings regarding UPS - there's never been a problem when I've shipped within Canada but when shipping over the border or trying to receive a package from the US, it's consistently been a nightmare. \nI didn't have to worry about any of that today, since it was only a fax I was sending to the US. And these guys took care of it quickly and efficiently, though I was kind of taken aback after my original copy got caught in the machine and they photocopied it for smoother sailing, then charged me for a copy as well as the fax. \nI wouldn't call the service exceptional, but the UPS Store did everything they were supposed to and my fax got to its destination safely, and that's all anyone can ask for.","stars":3}
{"text":"So they had a new guy on staff and I feel bad for him.. The store was pretty busy and he was fumbling around quite a bit. With only 2 people staffed during busy hours, it lead to long lines and fairly frustrated customers. Not the kid's fault at all - but definitely a huge fail on the manager's part to properly staff / prepare when you're training a new guy. Not the best experience ever..","stars":2}

{"text":"My wife showed up at 4:59 on 12/21/13.  I understand the store closes at 5 (although my wife didn't know it), but the woman in the store was locking the door and would not let my wife in.  She asked if it was \"a drop-off,\" and my wife said no, she needed a label.  The woman said \"I can't help you.  You'll have to come back tomorrow.\"  My wife said that was ridiculous, and the woman said \"Merry Christmas\" as she locked the door (I'm sure you can hear the sarcasm).  In any event, we've used this store a number of times, but they just lost our business forever.  Between FedEx, USPS and stores like The Mail Room, we don't need these guys.  When you can't compete on convenience or price, you need customer service.  Shame these guys never heard of it...","stars":1}
{"text":"The man on the phone Will, yelled at me within 15 seconds after he answered the call. I had a letter notarized and mailed from his store and when I was asking if there was a way for him to locate the transaction, I didn't articulate my question in perfect postal language (apparently the only one he knows how to speak and expects us all to know) and this set him off. I asked him if he was really yelling at me within fifteen seconds of talking with me and he confirmed he was and rudely interrupted me when I tried to ask him if we could track the lost letter. If this isn't his store or he doesn't have family ties to the owner, how does this employee still have a job? This is Quintessential Disgruntled Postal Worker.  Will you are not making America Great Again, suggestion to management: Multiple Choice  A.) Fire him before he implodes further and it becomes an innocent customers nightmare. B.) Maybe match his caveman skillset with a back of the house job that has no customer interface, C.) Put him on some medication.","stars":1}

God I wish there was an option to not have stuff go through UPS when ordering online - I'll take my luck with Canada Post any day.\n\n(also, as a previous reviewer mentioned - they never actually try to deliver anything. even when I've been quite literally home, I still leave to find a pick-up-your-packge slip taped to my door.

Even our local driver was appalled and embarrassed to see that the box, barely taped together, was bashed in with two sides gaping open. I wish I still had the pics I took.  The wooden, handmade chest was split in half and the bottom was in three pieces all because of very poor packing. My elderly uncle unknowingly shipped using this guy later. Send three boxes this time, only two arrived.  The papers, the frames, and other personal items were strewn about as if just tossed in the box. The third box took three and half MONTHS to arrive even after very many phone calls in which so many excuses were made it is impossible to recite all of them.  Ridiculous and unbelievable excuses only an idiot would believe. I intend to follow through with superiors as this store is full of lying, incompetent, and lazy people.

I asked if the box i wished to ship was adequate, she stated, \"not if you dont pay for a label.\" Now, i am not, nor have i ever been a UPS employee, but i have an IQ above 3 and realize that i need to pay for services. I then had to ask if i could indeed pay to have the package shipped. \n\nI provided the address, which was provided to me by the company receiving my package, and was informed that that address did not exist. She did take time an extra minute to try the address in another way and stated, \"this address can not be shipped to.\" I begrudgingly retrieved my package and went home. \n\nWhen i arrived at home, i went to UPS.com and have found the address and went to the point where i had to pay to print the label...but someone tell me why i would pay money to a company that treated me his way. I will now do all my business at Fed Ex.","stars":1}

{"text":"Amazing customer service! I usually ship through USPS because it tends to be less expensive. I was in a rush and didn't have time to deal with the post office. I dropped of a wrapped present at the UPS store and they boxed and shipped it for me.\n\nUnfortunately, the package was sent (ground) to Colorado instead of Southern California and delivery was delayed a few days. I called and spoke to someone at the store. They told me UPS screwed up and they would keep an eye on it for me. They also suggested I call back after delivery confirmation, and they would help me submit a claim to UPS to get my money refunded.\n\nLife happened and I got busy, totally forgot to file a claim. Yesterday (a little over three weeks after I shipped it), I received a check in the mail for my shipping cost. Yes, some awesome employee at this UPS Store location went ahead and filed the claim on my behalf. \n\nI have another package to ship and I will likely have them do it again, just so I can thank them in person. Well done!","stars":5}

Taking groupd out of the picture, the least expensive UPS \noption for guaranteed next day delivery was $22. He was so rude and nasty that I decided to go to the post office, where it cost me ~$16. The owner called me an idial as I walked out. Actually I was pretty smart to not spend an extra $6 over the post office for the exact same service.  and since the website says the ground option was guaranteed for my delivery, the owner shouldn't have contradicted the website.","stars":1}

She had the day off. And so I asked if the man on the phone was the person I spoke with the prior Monday and he said \"probably\".

It wasn't something I could do atwork, and since we were in the middle of getting ready to move, my personal scanner/printer had been shut down and packed.   On a whim I looked up this UPS store location.  I was able to email them to see if what I needed could even be done.  I got a very fast reply telling me that it could, and inviting me to stop in.\nI was able to get there on my lunch hour.  I was able to hand over the document.  It was scanned, emailed to me AND put on the flash drive I had brought along in less than 10 minutes, on top of that it only cost me $1.00.  \nI wish I remembered the name of the young lady who helped us.  She was very personable, knowledgeable and kind.  I am quite thankful to have this UPS store in my neighborhood.","stars":4}

{"text":"I have used the services at this store a number of times now for package return, overnight delivery, copying, enlarging and laminating services. The customer service provided here is excellent. Every single time I have come in the employees have been great, actually going above and beyond in some cases. It's just always a pleasant experience and you don't find that kind of consistently great service much anymore. A+!","stars":5}

{"text":"I used to go to this UPS store regularly to send packages to relatives across the country and very rarely to drop off packages with prepaid shipping labels. Most of the time when I've come here the employees are very friendly and helpful. However, one time recently I dropped off a package with a prepaid shipping label that needed tape (only the second time in years that I've asked them for tape) and a man who I believe was the owner chastised me for not taping my own box and threatened to charge me for it. The amount of tape he used on this box probably cost him no more than ten cents. If he felt that charging me was appropriate then he should've just charged me for it. I wouldn't have faulted him for charging me for something that cost him money. However, chastising a grown adult because they don't own packing tape is ridiculous. \n\nIn the future I will take my packages down the street to PostNet on Tanque Verde and Sabino. The employees there are friendly and treat customers with respect.","stars":1}

It is not even illegal to ship firearms to a licensed FFL or between private parties. Scopes and other accessories are allowed in a carry on big via TSA and DHE regs. Why is this place so restrictive? Safety? Hell no. They just want to ivory tower some infantile politic beliefs based on emotion. It's a private business and I respect their right to refuse service.

{"text":"I will never go here again. I had a package all ready to go with a return label already on it. I just wanted a tracking receipt. I felt harassed when the lady kept asking me what was in the box and is it packed in a way that it won't break. It was a company computer. I had just received a new computer and used the same box as I've done before to return the old computer. Packed nice and safe. I had to tell her several times it will be fine. I also had a small box with a tea infuser in it. Very small box. The lady kept asking over and over what is in the box. I kept telling her and then finally just opened the box and showed her. While this lady was \"helping\" me she asked for my phone number, I gave it to her. When my name didn't show up she questioned if it was the right number. I ask her if they keep that info, I also told her that I have only shipped once before with them a long time ago. She was not having it, she was persistent about my name and number as if I gave her the wrong information. Then I ask how long do they keep personal information, she said two years. I told her that I have not been there for two years. Then she ask my address, as I start giving it to her she looks at the customer next to me and said \"can I help you\" she totally interrupted me. The customer told her yes you can help me after you're done helping her. As I was giving her my address again she starts talking to her coworker directing him about packages that were dropped off. This lady was so scattered brained, unfocused and look like she has not slept in weeks. The icing on the cake was when she charged me $10 for the small package. I could have driven it myself for that cost. Never again!!!","stars":1}

Kelly Corsley helped us from taking the boxes from our car to labeling the boxes and weighing the shredding... And she did it in under 30 minutes!  If that's not impressive enough, she also called me from her personal cell phone to tell me I forgot my receipts.

I would not be surprised to hear her named the CEO of UPS someday!!","stars":5}
{"text":"This store is getting a 3 star review because of the great customer service provided by Tomas. He was so genuinely helpful and sincere and really cared about getting your packages set up for shipping quick and efficiently. He greeted me as soon as I walked in the door, walked me through the printing process for my shipping labels, very gently pointed out to me I initially sent my email to the wrong account for printing, and in general made it clear that my business was important to him. This store is really lucky to have him.l! The reason the review is not higher is because I think it is absolutely ridiculous to charge $3 + tax to print one single shipping label on just plain old paper. I understand the cost of convenience but $3 for one sheet of paper in only black ink?! Give me a break. I've gone to other UPS stores that charge less and was told by a woman at this store that UPS stores are franchises and each owner sets the cost of things how they want. Well, the owners at this store are happy to rip you off! I will be taking my business to other UPS stores in the area for this reason.","stars":3}

I mail a lot of packages, to a military spouse and two sons in college out of state, none of them will go through this store.  A very nice young lady started to help me and was interrupted by a very rude man (probably the manager or owner) I'm a pretty accommodating person, but to start with \"We can't\" and neither will FedEx (a box was wrapped in brown paper...I get it (I was trying to reuse a box) I'm also not cheap and would have been happy to fix it or have them help me, but as soon as his attitude became I don't need your business he got what he wants...he won't get it!

The other store in the area closes much later. I carried all my boxes to the front door and it's locked. 2:45 in the afternoon..... If you can't be open normal business hours for your customers then you should look into doing something else for a living. We will make sure we avoid coming there for our other printing and shipping needs for now on. \n\nThe business owner responded to me. The business owner asked what normal business hours should be????? I recommend look at hours of other UPS Stores in the region. 8:30am-7:00pm m-f and 8:30am-4:30pm on Saturday... I will continue to support those locations that have \"normal\" business hours and don't consider owning a business as a part time job or a hobby. Good luck.","stars":1}

It's close to my house, which is convenient for me! What I like about this particular store: the staff. Shipping items can be pricey and a somewhat confusing process but literally every time I have been there, the employees have been SUPER helpful. They've answered any questions I've had and have given me cheaper options (that I didn't know existed) for shipping. They have saved me a lot of money, which I appreciate!

I love it! \nIt makes me feel like even though Tucson is getting bigger and bigger, there are still locally owned businesses in this town where the owners REALLY CARE about each one of their customers and really want to give their best for the customer's benefit.\nCome to this store if you want to feel truly appreciated for your business.

Meaning I've mostly come in, pick up my mail & leave. With several other services over this duration utilized, like overnighting a package. \n\nAll said, just about bet my life that not once, have I failed to be greeted. Regardless of how busy they might have been. \n\nI've always found them professional first. As well, I benefit greatly from knowing I'll always get from them, a process that increases the value of the services provided, at the lowest possible costs. \n\nIt's a UPS store! How hard should that be, to run the outlet correctly? But, as a full time RV'er who also benefits from their flawless forwarding program, I've sure seen some goofed up outlets across the country.","stars":5}

They've always done their best to ensure that I am a satisfied customer and I always have been. \n\nCome on...if someone calculated a short fall on a service that I'd purchased, I'd expect them to contact me and let me know. I may not be thrilled about it, but I'd understand. New people often make mistakes. I made plenty of them when I was a new employee. Key words: EMPATHY & LOGIC. \n\nI also realize that people open businesses to make a profit (and this business probably has a low profit margin as it is) otherwise they end up closing their doors. \nThey have ALWAYS BEEN very professional with me and I appreciate it!\n\nMany thanks to Sam and his employees!","stars":5}

I was returning my AT&T DVR box as instructed by AT&T, and without ever greeting me or even asking what I needed he proceeded to unpack my box and when I asked him what he was doing he didn't respond. Now feeling suspicious and unsure of what he was doing I proceeded to grab the hardware and the box with the intention of leaving. This is when I asked if he was a UPS employee--he would not provide a  response--and when I proceeded to tell him that his customer service skills were horrible and that UPS should be ashamed that it allows a person such as him to wear their logo and represent their namesake. He told me to get the F@#$ out of is store and that I was a stupid F$@&in idiot! I have since called UPS corporate - and was informed that he has received several complaints. I went to the UPS store on Baring blvd where I was treated like a customer and they actually wanted my business. They even apologized for their fellow business owner's behavior!\n\nBEWARE....STAY AWAY FROM THIS  STORE AND OWNER!!","stars":1}
{"text":"This UPS Store is pretty great for receiving packages, for shipping things via UPS, and for some other services including faxing documents. If you live in the area UPS will often drop off your packages here for pickup AS LONG AS you don't owe customs/duty (if you do, you have to be home for one of UPS's deliveries, or it'll get returned to sender, as a warning!!). They also have mailboxes for rent.\n\nWhile I don't mind receiving domestic packages, I dislike using UPS when shipping across the border. That said, not all businesses give you options when it comes to this type of thing, so depending on what I want shipped I may have to deal with this anyway.","stars":3}

This caused utter confusion as I didn't understand if she was talking to me or the customer on the phone. My confusion led her to take an even harsher tone with me. Instead of asking what I needed, she assumed I was there for an amazon return, which was incorrect. When I tried to explain I was there to return att equipment, she cut me off and explained why she was right. \n\nThe interaction ended with her telling me att is unreliable with return verification, so I need to keep the receipt forever. \n\nI would recommend helping one customer at a time, so each customer receives the quality customer service they deserve.","stars":1}

At this point I was interrupted by another worker there to tell me I would need to take my helmet off in the future. Funny thing is that I had my gloves off and was about to take off my helmet when he said this. His tone was definitely not friendly and completely put me off from ever doing business with this location. There are plenty of UPS Stores around so I will go to them.

{"text":"If I could give this location 0 stars, I would.  \n\nI came in today to make 8 double sided, color copies, 40 pages each. After doing some research online, I decided to stop by here, on my way home, to make the colored copies I needed for work. \n\nAs I walked in, the gentlemen behind the counter didn't even bat an eye or acknowledge my existence coming into his establishment. Whatever. I'm fully capable of utilizing a copy machine. He's probably having a crappy day. I get it. I work in the retail industry myself and we all have bad days. \n\nI proceeded to make the appropriate selection on the machine for the copies I needed, totally minding my own business. Half way through the first packet, the paper ran out. I turned around and politely notified him that the machine was out of paper. He mumbled something beneath his breath and slowly made his way out from behind the counter and over to gather some more paper. He made a snide comment that I was making a lot of copies. I jokingly replied back, yup, I was there to butcher a tree's worth of paper, in order to suffice the copies I needed. Clearly he didn't get it or care and closed the paper drawer and walked away.\n\nAt one point, I looked over my shoulder and noticed he was staring at me. Weird. Finally after what seemed like forever, the pages finished printing and I grabbed my stuff and walked towards the counter to pay for my copies. He came over and made a comment about how beautifully the copy machine had printed the colors. I agreed with him and told him they looked good. \n\nHe proceeded to ring up my transaction and walked back and forth to a calculator off to the side, typing in numbers and coming up with a total. Once he was done he punched in some numbers at the register and just stared at me. I looked over at the total and thought to myself, \"you've got to be shitting me\". The total was over $1,200! I asked him if they delivered, since apparently I was buying the copy machine? Again, he didn't understand. I asked him how much he was charging me per colored, double sided sheet. He started going on about prices and how their competition has driven prices and how he's giving me a discount, since I was ordering so much. I politely interrupted him and asked him how much per sheet and if I could take a look at their price listing, since they were no where visibly posted. \nHe pulled out a booklet and flipped through multiple pages. As he flipped through this catalog, I also pulled up the UPS Store's website and looked up the info to order colored copies, in order to compare the prices. Another customer had walked in at some point during this, and I thought to myself, since clearly this was going to be long, I would let him help this other customer. The other customer finished and left. \n\nI found the online ordering, to pick up in store section and pulled up the prices: For 40 double sided pages, printed in color, totaling 8 sets and nothing else(not even staples), this came out to $124.80! I began to ask him how he made it from $124.80 to over $1,200? He couldn't say. He proceeded to start the transaction over and this time it came out to $700. I told him I wouldn't be paying for anything over the $124.80. He scoffed and said he was sorry and didn't understand why I was getting frustrated.\n\nHe proceeded to grab his phone and show me a video he had on there, of a little boy placing money into his diaper, as his parents laughed in the background. I was confused. What did this have anything to do with anything? He simply said he was trying to get me to laugh, since clearly I was not happy. No shit. \n\nHe proceeded to try and explain how his prices don't ever match the online prices, and I should have just placed the order online so I wouldn't have to be in the store discussing the prices with him in person. He continued to insist, that I should have placed the order and just came in to pick it up and he would never know how much I paid. Seriously?\n\nHe rang up the transaction for a third time and this time the total came out to over $400. I asked him what prices and formula of math he was using, to come up with these ridiculous totals. He said, \"I've given you another discount\". I told him I didn't want a discount and just wanted to pay for my copies and leave. \n\nEventually, I told him I was tired of his games and asked for his name, his manager's name and the number to their customer service office. I let him know I would be calling them to inform them of this scam he's trying to pull. He told me his name was Sam, but he couldn't give me his manager's name or the company's customer service number. Or he just didn't want to. Either way, while Sam is working here, I will never step foot in this establishment again. \n\nI advise you find yourself a different place to make copies. Don't bother going here.","stars":1}

As part of that process, there was the \"dividing up of the things.\"  Between the siblings, there were about 9 boxes to ship home.  This particular UPS store went over and above. We ended up showing up about 20 minutes prior to close time and they were beyond helpful.  They repacked a couple of the boxes due to the fragile nature of the items in there.  They made sure that we had everything we needed.  Fast forward to the receipt of the boxes? OMG...we were floored.  Everything was packed with the utmost of care.  Nothing came broken (with the exception of one leg on a ceramic cow...which I think I did when packing it initially!).

{"text":"Waaaay over and above!!! I have been here several times for packing and shipping an assortment of things. Always, always the staff (and owners) have been more than helpful. Today, I was with a friend and we were picking up a large package to take away with us, there was no way this item would have fit in my friend's car, so the owner/manager (Thoren, I think his name is) offered to put this item on the top of his SUV and deliver it, for my friend, to it's destination!!! Wow! I have never heard of this. What outstanding, and over and above, customer service!! You wouldn't think this type of kindness and customer service still existed---but IT DOES!! Sooo thankful for this UPS store and it's great customer service and sincere, much appreciated, kindness. Thank you!!!!","stars":5}
{"text":"Talk about customer service! This is the place!! Nick (cheerfully) went out of his way to take care of my package (after I messed it up). I thought this type of customer care was a thing of the past, nice to see there are excellent employees taking pride in their work. Three cheers for the UPS store in Green Mount Crossing.","stars":5}
{"text":"Bad service bad attitude.\n\nWas not greeted upon entering the store and while there were no other customers and 2 employees on duty, they made me wait for about 10 minutes because they were busy finishing some other duties. At a minimum they should have greeted and had a good attitude. I have been here 2 times and both experiences have been sub par. Only use this store if you absolutely have to.","stars":1}
{"text":"I went here a few times and nothing bad, nothing great. There is usually a line. However I thought that I need to review to you know that you can deposit money into USAA. We always had issues when we had a ton of cash needed to deposit it with nowhere to deposit it into.","stars":3}

They've done everything from menus to signs for us and I'm always happy with the end product. I can't recommend them enough for their business services!","stars":5}
{"text":"This is by far the best UPS store I have been to in St. Pete. It might not seem like a big deal, but the parking situation is great to help you get in and out quickly. You are not dealing with a grocery store parking lot or the stress of finding parking downtown. Next, the staff is beyond friendly and helpful. You are greeted immediately when you walk in and they help you as quickly as they can, even when there is a line. The store is well maintained and very nice inside. I sent art prints to this location so I could frame them for my daughter's nursery before her arrival. They were completed same day and the quality was excellent. I messed up the first set, and they gave me a discount when I reordered the prints, even though it was my fault, not theirs. I highly recommend using this UPS location for the convenience, quality, and excellent customer service!","stars":5}
{"text":"After waiting 2 weeks for an order of business cards that were promised to be done in 1 week and several trips to the store, I went in yesterday to find that they were done but I hadn't received a call they were ready for pick up. I opened the box and they were very poor quality printed cards with the image not even extending to the edges of the cards leaving a white stripe on every single one rendering them useless. I've canceled my order and will not be doing business with them again.\nThey don't answer the phone. They don't have a voicemail set up so you can't leave a message. They don't even come to the counter when you walk in the store! You have to yell for someone.","stars":1}

{"text":"Worst customer service! Terrible! The woman who was at the front counter is so rude and seemingly miserable. Over the summer I used this store to return several Amazon packages. One of those packages was never actually returned to Amazon so I was charged for an item I never kept! Yesterday I mistakenly decided to give this store another chance with my Amazon return. When I asked for a receipt the same rude woman, curtly and hastily tossed a torn receipt at me stating, \"the tracking number will be invalid anyway because it's going in one box.\" She then turned around and walked away from me. I wish I could give this store one star but it's not an option. Some people should never work in customer service.","stars":1}
{"text":"My experience here 2 weeks ago was just wonderful! Sam, the owner, took care of me when I needed to ship a ton of stuff back home to Virginia. He was able to pack my stuff, some of which were fragile, and he provided me with the best options to ship it. Thanks to Sam and UPS, I received my packages on time and in perfect condition!!!  Excellent customer service all throughout. If I'm ever in town again and need to ship some things I now know where to go!","stars":5}
{"text":"This location solved a very difficult shipment issue and did exactly what they promised. I can trust for the store and its personnel. \n\nThey resolved a problem, we had two other shipments in the 24 hours through other locations where were very poorly handled. This issue was done correctly. \nA good location.","stars":5}

{"text":"I believe the negative reviews here are the result of some ethnic dislikers who mask their jingoistic attitudes as the problem of \"this Asian woman.\" Well folks, don't listen to them. I have done business with this Owner for 8 years, and she has been nothing but the nicest, most efficient, helpful small business owner that I have ever come across. She begins every interaction with a smile and a desire to help. Of course, I always walk in with a smile. I would be willing to bet that many bring a nasty attitude in with them, so they should not be surprised if they are met in kind.  I urge others to see for yourselves and then post your own experiences here.","stars":5}

After 26 years in business, Scott and other veteran employees can assess their customers' needs as soon as they walk through the door.

The Olivette UPS store is a one-stop shop for shipping, packaging, notary services and so much more.","stars":5}
{"text":"My experiences there have been decidedly above average! I do quite a bit of shipping , plus business scanning, special mailing and notary services. My only criticism is that some of the trainees seem to take quite a while to catch on, but everyone is very nice and accommodating...perhaps the last reviewer did not understand that comments made were tongue in cheek??","stars":4}

{"text":"I have gone to this store multiple times, only because it is so close to my house. A while back, there was a very friendly young girl who worked there, and i enjoyed my interactions with her. Unfortunately, I have not seen her in a while, and I have only had to deal with the same incredibly rude man every time I've been in there. \n\nOn one occasion, I went in to ask for stamps and he literally looked me dead in the eye, said \"All out\", turned around and went into the back of the store. Every time I have asked for a receipt with the tracking information, he acts like I have completely ruined his day and inconvenienced him.\n\nAfter all of my encounters with this blatantly rude man, yesterday was the tipping point. I don't care how far I have to drive from now on, I will NEVER give him any business again.\n\nI went in and IN FRONT OF HIM, I grabbed a large manila envelope off of the shelf. I then stood at the kiosk and put my package in. I went to the desk with my printed return shipping label (for a return at an online store), and he just stared at me. I told him I just needed to send the return, and he literally tossed a plastic sleeve at me for the label. I began to put the paper in, and it got caught on the corner as I placed it inside the sleeve. He made a snide remark asking me if I thought I could get it in. I then started to take off the plastic on the back to reveal the sticky part, and he said, \"No!\" and grabbed it out of my hand. He then proceeded to rip the backing off, leaving half of it on the sleeve, so it wouldn't fully stick. He smashed it onto the envelope, then asked \"IS THIS YOURS?\" while pointing to the envelope. I told him no, I needed to purchase it. He rolled his eyes and said ok, like I was trying to steal it. He rang it up, didn't say the total, and rudely said, \"Put your card in.\" I asked for a receipt with tracking info, and he sighed, then shoved it towards me and said \"Here.\" \n\nI will never step foot in this store again.","stars":1}
{"text":"Like many people, we had to get something notarized and due to search results, we went to UPS to get this done. When we tried to walk in, there was a woman standing in the doorway on her cell phone who was noticeably aggravated at something and a young, blonde clerk who came out from the back with an attitude saying, \"I still have things to pack.\" Obviously, something was happening at the time that they were stressed about but it didn't concern us. The clerk rudely asked us what we needed and did not exhibit any sort of customer service skills. We kindly handed her our paper and while she's looking at it, picks up the phone for another customer and rudely says, \"what do you need done?\" - something throughout all my years of customer service, have never witnessed when a representative of the company answers a phone to a customer. I suppose he also was calling about a notary. I have no idea, considering she mumbled the entire time and had nothing but an attitude with him. While still on the phone she hands us our papers back saying they can't do the notary of this specific form and have to go to the same place as what she's telling the customer on the phone - which by the way is false considering we called the place she's telling everyone to go. No eye contact. We didn't even realize she was talking to us until she rudely handed us back our paper. \n\nThis isn't a matter of us perhaps not reading the fine print of their services. It's a complaint over the level of disrespect their staff hold toward customers. I seen a review where someone was complaining about the same thing and I assume the local business owner disagreed and defended the store. If that's any indication of the kind of business they're running, stay far, far away.","stars":1}
{"text":"I have gone to this UPS store several times and was quite pleased with it. however recently I went to take a passport photo which was done incorrectly so I went back to the UPS store to get my money back and I think it was only $10. I was told that only the owner can approve a refund and that was two months ago and I've gone back twice and keep being told that the owner has not been in. I know it's only $10 but it's the principle. Due to this I will no longer use this ups for my services.","stars":1}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day because when I canceled my AT&T U-verse services they emailed me this piece of paper and told me to bring my DVR box and gateway to the UPS store along with the piece of paper. I thought that was a pretty sweet idea, better than me having to locate some branch office to drop this stuff off at. But I digress, back to the UPS store. I walked in and there was one lady helping out with notary services, which they also offer, and after a couple moments I was helped by a young lady. She started the process of scanning in my stuff and a few minutes later I was given a receipt showing I dropped off the equipment and was sent on my merry way. \n\nI was in and out in just a few minutes, but the computer seemed to not want to process my request as while the computer was chugging along she helped several other people with drop offs while the computer slowly chugged away at my request. I thought this was cool, and kudos to her for doing everything she cold to keep the line short, though it could have been the fact that she was doing the 5 year \"I gotta PEE\" dance and trying to take care of everyone so she could run to the bathroom. \n\nWhile not overly \"WOWed\", they were definitely better than Meh, so they are A-ok in my book.","stars":3}

They were to update me on a new tracking number 3 days ago but have not.

He was to call me back in 20 minutes with an answer, that was 2 days ago! Still waiting for that call JACK!   Wish I could have given 0 stars. So been 8 business days and no reply from anyone! NO WONDER FEDEX IS RATED THE NUMBER ONE SHIPPER. My advice is stay away from this store and UPS, ship Fedex .","stars":1}

No need to have to go multiple places. They handle it all. I don't mind paying a few extra dollars either with the quality service they provide. Also, they are a local family run business which everyone should appreciate & support. You can tell they take pride & actually care!","stars":5}

The UPS Store helped me mark a few things off my little list of love but I can't say that the customer service was pleasant. \n\nThe lady behind the counter was busy behind the counter when I arrived and didn't acknowledge me until I said hello. She said that she'd be with me after she finished whatever task she was working on.\n\nShe wasn't pleasant but I was thankful that they were there.  Maybe she was having a bad day or maybe this is her personality. Either way, it would be nice to feel valued.","stars":2}

{"text":"Despite some other no so positive reviews, I use this UPS Store for all my shipping needs.  The gentleman who operates this store is very kind and easy to chat with.  \n\nI drop off all my Zappos returns (who doesn't love shoes) and other online shopping returns free of charge.  Note: Two other mail stores on the south side of town want up to $2 a box to drop off free return items.  \n\nI also use the store to drop off items that I ship to my family back east.  They are always packaged gently and arrive on time.  It is easy for the staff to pull up my account by phone number; all my frequent shipping addresses are stored in my account for easy access.  This expedites the process and gets me in and out of the store quickly.  \n\nThe price can be a little higher than I have experienced at other mail stores but the care provided is worth a few extra dollars to me!","stars":5}

If you need a UPS store, this is the place! They definitely will have my business for years to come!","stars":5}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I wrapped a shoe box return in brown paper and fixed UPS label on box. Woman on desk said they don't like to mail paper wrapped boxes which I now get due to possibility of tearing with label. She proceeded to try and sell me $6 box and was upset I was taking risk. She then roughly tossed box and told me she doesn't make money from me dropping off box.","stars":1}
{"text":"I will never use this UPS Store location again.  Having used it three times in the last six weeks with the same result, I'm done with this place.  There are two women who could be sisters, that appear to own the place.  They are horrible to deal with.  They act like it's an imposition to wait on you.  They have no idea or don't care what customer service is.  I have seen two employees, one an older lady and the other a younger man, who are pleasant and seem quite nice but you take your chance of getting one of them or getting one of horrible women I mentioned first.","stars":1}
{"text":"Recently I graced this branch with my presence to drop off a few packages the UPS truck failed to pick up at my place of business. Upon entering the neat and tidy store I witnessed a full counter as typical of the holiday season and everyone panicked to get their respective gifts to their destination on time. I was initially greeted by a young man (later found out was Austin) the moment I stepped through the door and made me feel welcome, a lot of shops fail to do that sort of thing. I saw Austin was busy with a customer who just seemed to not get it, he was trying to patiently explain things and saw I was waiting for help, he hollered for Tyler who came bounding in from the back with a bright smile on his face and a pleasant attitude. He quickly scanned my packages and instructed me to have a great night. Overall was a great experience and will certainly return for all my shipping needs.","stars":5}

The people here are totally willing to help you with all of the paperwork, even completing some of the forms for me in the past.  \n\nI have always been in and out of here very quickly.  The few times where there has been a bit of a line, someone always appears from the back to help the line move along quickly.  It's as though they get paid per customer, which is great.","stars":4}

I'm already using your service to ship my item why do you want to up charge? When I chose to leave she got an attitude.\n\n Replying to owner: \nA strip of tape should not cost $1. Funny how after I left your store I went  to the UPS store near you and they not only gave me the strip of tape for the shoe box but also taped it for me! You're in the business of packaging! I understand a charge if I had to use various strips of tape but be a bit flexible. One strip of tape over a customer? Look at the other reviews.. they said the same.

I needed to drop post office boxes and I really had to work to get information. Yes. They do post office. That's it. Im glad I asked if the post pick up had happened for the day because it had and it was only 2:00pm. You think he would be more forthcoming with relevant information like that. No greeting or hello.

I already reported this store to Corporate Headquarters and they will file a formal complaint against this store, however, I do not understand why this man continues to be allowed to operate a UPS Store after all of these negative reviews. Before driving a half hour to this store, I called over and over hoping that they would answer and the phone went directly to voicemail.  There was no way to leave a message.  The voicemail states to keep trying to call back which is what I did.  When I pulled up to the store, the man who I think is named Norman was resting in his chair with his arms above his head with NO ONE in the store.  I called from my car while watching and again, he did not get up to answer the phone.  When I went into the store to tell him, he was rude to me and shook his head and blew me off.  I even tried to call from my phone while he was standing there and he could have cared less.  I asked him if he was the manager and he said yes.  I asked  him who he reported to and he said \"What's it to you?\"  I told him I was going to report him and he sat back down and said \"Go ahead, I am afraid!!!\" (Sarcastically)  I was unable to get his name or his manager's name, so I called the next day hoping to get another person  on duty to tell me his name, it had to be him that answered because when I asked him if he was working the night before, he hung up on me!   I informed UPS and I will let my friends and family know to stay far away from this store!","stars":1}
{"text":"Nice capable staff. They have NPR on, which is a such a nice improvement over the hideous top 40 music most stores play. But the upcharge is ASTRONOMICAL! Of course, they call it a service fee. I call it gouging. To ship a box via Parcel Post, I was quoted about $14 at this store. I then took it to the PO and paid a tad over $8. At over 40% upcharge, I think I can stand to go to Fed Ex, UPS or the PO. Use this store or this type of store in an emergency or plan to spend way more than you should.","stars":3}

Every time I ended up missing a package just to call the next day and a girl states oh yeah we have that package for you...wtf how hard is it to hand me all my packages at once?? now I have two Amazon orders that states that they came and we're signed by a female there. Do you think I have my package yet? No and I've been to the store 3 times and not once have they handed it to me even when I ask for all my boxes. Now I guess I have to babysit my tracking #'S and go in with a list and check off each tracking # before I leave the store. This is annoying especially BC I have had another ups store in a different state not only did they notify me when my packages arrived, which this place does NOT but they also gave me all my packages at once. Oh and FYI it's rude if you lose a package to laugh and say ahaha I'm new...wtf!!! pissed","stars":1}
{"text":"These are some the rudest, most incompetent people I have ever dealt with in my life. I tried to send photos nearly a month ago and I was charged nearly $18 just for domestic ground shipping a few photos. (It turns out I could have shipped using the U.S. post office for less than $7!) The photos were never delivered, the recipient was never notified that a delivery attempt was made and then the photos sat in a warehouse. Neither my relative nor myself were notified that the envelope was waiting to be picked up and when I realized it had been past the estimated delivery date, I checked online and UPS had already decided (without notifying me or the recipient) to return the envelope to the UPS store from where it was originally sent. I called UPS customer service to fix the issue or to receive a refund and they told me that the store would have to do the refund. Many days later when it finally arrived at the UPS store, I went to pick it up and the rude, smug woman \"working\" there told me this did not qualify for a refund. Their main purpose is to ship to the correct address in a certain amount of time, this was not accomplished, how on earth does this not qualify for a refund?! The woman at the store told me I would have to call customer service again to try to get a refund, so I reluctantly called again and they told me again it was the UPS stores responsibility to refund the money. While I was on the phone the woman \"working\" at the store rudely talked over the phone customer service rep to talk about giving me a print out of UPS's delivery failures for this envelope, as if that would help resolve the issue. When I ended the disastrous customer service conversation, with someone who barely spoke English, the woman \"working\" at the store was hiding behind a wall to avoid helping me resolve this issue. The male coworker behind the counter had his head down avoiding eye contact with me the entire time, likely because he knew I deserved a refund but could not speak up for fear of retribution. I was polite and calm considering the circumstance but manners didn't help. I was beyond frustrated, so I left without a refund. From now on, I will ship with the U.S. post office or FedEx. Even a carrier pigeon would have been faster, cheaper, more polite and reliable!","stars":1}

{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for places like the UPS Store but in this case I really wanted to especially after I saw the bad reviews it had.  I had a great experience here.  I had something I needed notarized.  I arrived around 6 on a weekday and the manager (I think) that does their notary works 8-5.  I was disappointed since I work during those hours and the guy helping me suggested another place that also offers a notary service and gave me their phone number.  He also gave me a business card for the UPS Store and said to call before I left for work the next day to see if the manager might be there a bit early and could notarize my document.  I called the next morning and she was in early so I headed over.  I was helped right away and once I asked the cost I found out it was $1.  That is amazing!!! I moved here from Dallas and the place I went there charged $9 per sheet of paper.  It was another 10 cents for a copy for me to keep and I was out in less than 5 mins.\n\nSuper helpful employees!","stars":5}

It is so poor that I would rather drop my packages off at the local Post Office, stand in a longer line, and pay more. \n\nAnd she kept pushing to have UPS re-package all of my packages because they can charge me more money. I had 3 packages. I did a great job packaging my own. I always do. I use a lot of bubble wrap, sturdy well taped boxes (used my Amazon boxes), labeled them very clearly, etc. but, she says they won't do a thing if they damage the contents if UPS didn't pack them. Really? So - she kept pushing me to have them tear them apart & repack them. No.  Not wasting my time & money. So I asked - are you planning on drip kicking them across the lawn? She said - we tell everyone to imagine it's a big football field out there. Wait...what? Ok so yes you are planning on drop kicking them. Good to know. \n\nI'm not spending extra money for them to do the packaging. \n\nShe also wanted to know the detailed contents of every box. And she typed it all into the computer. One question they ask is if there are gift cards in the box. I asked why. She said so that they can know if they get stolen. So I pointed out that she was typing all the contents into her computer so that everyone who worked there could see what was in each box - so they could open them if they wanted. I had Christmas presents in every box and was ver uncomfortable with this. Plus, I feel it is an invasion of my privacy. \n\nSo then she changed her tune & said they had to know if there were any hazardous items in the boxes. But that's not what they ask. I pointed out that the Post Office has them posted in the wall and just asks about it; but not for me to tell them what is in every box. \n\nI used to go to the UPS store by the mall and never was questioned like this or pushed to repackage everything.

As for Sam, he should in no way be allowed to be associated with the UPS name. He is a horrible businessman and care not a whit about customers.\n\nMy saga began shortly after moving to Sparks, when my husband went on a trip to Atlanta and needed medication sent to him. I was in there first thing on a Thursday morning in early September, probably about 9:10 because the employee was late. I paid the extra bit to be sure the package would arrive at my husband's hotel by 10:30 the following morning. It arrived after 1:00 PM. I called to complain and was never able to speak to Sam because he simply does not return phone calls. I spoke with management and they assured me Sam would get back to me...nope. Whatever, what's done is done. I should have read the other reviews here by this time, but I didn't.\n\nSo I went back on Oct. 23 to return a bicycle pump for my husband for repair. He got it on sale for about $100, but it's an easy return, right? No reason to buy insurance or anything to have the people and the company just do their jobs. Well....I checked the tracking after about a week, only to find that the package apparently never left the UPS store. I started calling and wound up speaking with the above-mentioned sarcastic Eve. I started keeping track of the calls to Eve--Sam never bothered to talk to me--and never got any results, and even got to the point where I have to think that she started telling untruths about what corporate was doing, because corporate told me quite a different story. I then started speaking only with corporate and emailing invoices and such. Without going into even more detail, I will say that I received a refund from the store more than two months after this saga started. Understand that I contacted corporate in early January to find out the status of the refund, and was told that the store had had the check for who knows how long. When I went to pick up the check, it had a note on it to \"call customer for pickup,\" but of course that did not happen.

I was not greeted - your two employees were both visibly annoyed (one of which was counting the till before closing), and they barely spoke a word to me the entire time.

This store has a high turnaround of their staff and do not train their employees properly.","stars":1}
{"text":"I have been a customer for years with my business. They do seem to have some great employees and sometimes some new and learning employees, I understand the businesses frustration, because I work with it. Have been there many times watching irate customers flip out over literally nothing. If you don't like something ask for the manager's contact and let them know, instead of acting like a spoiled brat having a tantrum. I have contacted manager a few times explained what happened and the employee got trained and there wasnt any further issue.  I will continue to use this location. I do wish the hours where a little different, but businesses do what they have to do. I would recommend a package secure box similar to amazon drop boxes. Where people can pick up packages anytime. It just saves an extra trip.","stars":5}

He asked me if I had a concealed permit.  Learn yur laws sir.  I don't care if Yu have a sign or not on yur window.  I could have put my shirt over it and Yu would not have noticed a thing.

{"text":"I brought a package in and they told me it would be delivered on a certain date. It wasn't. It was delayed by at least three days, apparently sat in globe Arizona for two of them. I was never told there could be a delay but when I called to ask what happened they Can't guarantee delivery dates. What is the point of telling me a date if it doesn't happen? I took the exact same type of package to FedEx the following week and for half the price the package got there in three days. No more UPS for me!","stars":2}

{"text":"I was stopping at the Target store on Manchester at Holloway Rd and I needed to drop a package off at the UPS store to return to Bloomingdale's. When you shop online it seems like you're always dropping something off! I realized this UPS store is in the strip center right in front of Target in between the vape store and a learning center. Perfect! I dropped off the box, got the receipt, and was on my way. I'll be back next time I'm in the area.","stars":4}
{"text":"This is the worst UPS I've ever had to unfortunately live in the vicinity of. They are never on time. They skip deliveries. They are rude and grumpy. I dread having to order things because I have to wait an eternity to receive things because apparently sometimes packages come at 7am and others 7pm. Even when I pay for early shipping they don't hold up their end of the deal. It's disgusting and a waste. If you can avoid UPS and go through FedEx or really anything else, you're better off.","stars":1}
{"text":"My first impression, over the phone, when I called to verify their business hours was not great. The gentleman that answered the phone was the not friendly. If I had another choice for shipping nearby the phone interaction alone was enough for me to have gone elsewhere, however, the package needed to go out right away so I went in anyway. Looks like this is a pattern from other reviewers. To my surprise, when I arrived I was greeted by two very friendly employees. I wish I could remember the name of the male employee that helped me out. I  arrived about 10 minutes before closing time.  He was friendly and efficient. My packages arrived on time as well! Customer service is what sets businesses apart. People want to support the businesses that make them feel welcomed and appreciated. The staff up front is very nice, so this review is my token of appreciation to them.","stars":4}

After arriving it was determined by the 3rd party agency I had the wrong ID's and would not be able to complete task.  The UPS staff was great but the Manager lacked credibility and business professionalism in she provided false info and no resolution support. A waste of my time.  I was told I not allowed back, trust me I will not go back and plan to inform other business associates","stars":1}
{"text":"This store is excellent. They help people very quickly and efficiently. I've never waited more than a minute or two. I've felt very safe coming here during COVID because the staff has always been masked whereas the DTSP USP store had not a single employee masked. I'll continued to frequent this one up near Gandy.","stars":5}
{"text":"I went to this store in the past & had no issues until this last visit (6/12/20).  They changed the store around due to Covid-19.  There is a sign on the door that says \"Only 2 customers at a time\". Now, that is not the issue.  The issue is they moved the service desk & you can not see it from the door when you look in to see how many customers are in there! You look in & can only see mailboxes on the wall.  I walked in, after seeing only 1 person in there & of course wearing a mask.  I was yelled at to wait outside because there already were two people in there (one was at the desk) The layout is bad for customers.  What's worse is the people that work there were flat out nasty!  I tried to explain the set up is not good as customers outside can't look in to see how many people are in the store, the girl said, well that's how it is & you need to step outside.  I fully understand rules, especially during Covid but there is no reason to be rude/nasty at all! \n\nOn the plus side, the girl who waited on me was awesome! She came out from the back. The other 2, horrible, seemed to be bothered to do their job & were very rude. I'd suggest putting the desk reception desk back so customers outside can see how many people are in the store to adhere to these new rules & not get yelled at, quite embarrassing also.  I won't be going back to Marlton store even tho I work in Marlton, I'd rather go out of my way & go to the Voorhees Store!","stars":1}

{"text":"This is the best UPS store! I was out running errands for the first time with my 9 week old baby and had to ship two packages. as I was putting my baby in the carrier and wondering how I was also going to carry the boxes inside, Alexus, the manager of the store came out to assist me. She carried my packages inside for me and insisted that I stay inside my air-conditioned car with the baby. She brought me a pen and paper to write down the addresses, gave me different options for shipping and then took my credit card inside to complete the transaction. I cannot think her enough for her help. It was such a relief not to have to enter the store and carry the packages with my newborn baby. I have had several other wonderful experiences in the store as well!! Everyone is very friendly and they take Covid precautions seriously.","stars":5}
{"text":"Charged $2 for 18 inches of tape to close the the box I was shipping. Really? Never been charged for this courtesy in all the years I have used UPS, FEDEX and USPS. Luckily, I had cash to pay for this unheard of fee, since they have a $10 minimum for credit cards. Had the clerk been more understanding of my bewilderment, I probably would have skipped writing a review. But, no. She was rude. So here it is. This location...never again.","stars":1}
{"text":"I visited this store today and was greeted and assisted by a lovely gentleman named Todd who helped me save money and ship my item in a timely, affordable method. Unfortunately, while I was there, his counterpart at the desk was being unfairly/unjustifiably berated by a rude patron. Both employees handled the situation with respect and patience, despite the way she was speaking to them.

{"text":"During Christmas week-Mailed 3 packages. Labels got crossed on 2 packages. I called on Saturday and was told Monday Manager would get back to me. No call on Monday, I called Tuesday staffer said Manager was working on it yesterday and will get back to me. Later Tuesday, Manager called and said she doesn't work on Monday and she just got in and my message. Meanwhile since it was Christmas week, I corrected their mistake myself. Manager only conveyed what owner told her to do, I was very upset considering it was inconvenient to 3 families during Christmas week. I spoke to the owner Mark he stated he would refund me. I emailed the receipts and he replied to confirm he would mail a check and nothing has been sent since 12/23/20.\n\nIf uses them at Blue Bell/Pottstown double check their work otherwise you would have to their work for them!!!","stars":1}
{"text":"I told myself I would not use this UPS location ever again as the last time I did, the owner was very curt when I informed him that 2 cards I left to be mailed were never received - he blamed it on the post office and offered no apologies.\nI had to do an Amazon return for work today - it was a printer - I boxed it up exactly as it had arrived but I did not have any clear packaging tape. When I asked the staff member to put a piece of tape on the box she informed me that they are now charging $2 for tape! That is for a 15 inch piece of clear packing tape! Ridiculous! I will NEVER use this store again.","stars":1}

{"text":"UPS has become the most customer-hostile shipping company I've ever dealt with. A few years ago, they'd make their silly \"delivery attempts\" and then hold a package for a few weeks so you could come pick it up.\n\nThings are different, now. Immediately after their third \"attempt\"--that very evening--they returned my four boxes of goods to the shipper, and told me there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.\n\nNow that I know their new policy, of course, I could have them hold it up to 5 days next time--if I sign up for an account and pay a fee.\n\nIf I have anything to say about it, \"next time\" will be DHL, USPS, or fedex.","stars":1}
{"text":"will not be using this UPS location in the future. I was in on 8/21/2020 and the gentleman working, who I've had previous unpleasant experiences with, was at it again. This time he was not exactly rude to me, although he was not particularly friendly either, but he was extremely rude to the patron in front of me. He seems to get an attitude if you have too many items to address and makes rude comments as he handles your transaction. The last time I was in this location, I was tempted to reach out to management due to how rude he was, but decided not to bother, maybe he was just having a bad day. NOPE! Unless he has lots of bad days. I would also like to mention that the patron ahead of me, just as I had in my previous visits, responded to the employee with nothing but kindness as he continued to be rude throughout the transaction. Especially during this time, when we're all dealing with the extra stressors of covid, people should be trying extra hard to be kind and pleasant to one another. The previous staff was always so kind & friendly. Where did they go?! I use this location because it located close to where I work a few days a week and it was convenientfor me to handle everything during my work day. My last few visits have been so unpleasant that I will now be going to one of the locations closer to my home in West Chester and will not be patronizing this location again","stars":1}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to location to ship packages. Today the store was quite full, with six or seven people in line, in a rather small space. I was so disappointed that the management allowed customers into the crowded and closely confined store without masks on. It was incredibly unfair to all of the customers following the local ordinance and taking the proper precautions. The store had the 'face-covering required' sign posted on the door and really should enforce the rule to protect clients.","stars":1}
{"text":"I love this ups store.  They are friendly and always willing to help me get my items packaged and sent.","stars":5}
{"text":"When I pulled up I saw the line was back to the door and there was only 1 employee. I thought that this was going to be a long, boring experience, but boy was I wrong. The gentleman at the counter really knew his stuff, and would work 2 customers at once for a while. He was always friendly even though he was slammed. I came up with my box open and needed a label and it to be packaged up. He has me in and out within 10 minutes. And that is with the long line. This will now be my go to store for all my shipping needs.","stars":5}
{"text":"Every time I come to this store it has issues. I am trying to return a Amazon return and his system is down apparently for Amazon. So I called another UPS 3 miles away and they are having no issues. Seriously, this store has no contingency plans for running a business?","stars":1}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but perhaps my expectations were too high. I have a UPS business account, and love their shipping services and customer service. So I expected to find that same level of service in the store. Since this is franchised I believe, my review can't be expected to apply to any other location. But this one? They would not allow me to ship using my own account number. What? I had to pay full price, no discount for being a UPS customer. In essence they didn't want my business. They charged me the same for a 7 lb package as an 11 lb package, meaning they were going off of size not weight. They could have offered to provide a smaller or different size box to use to reduce the cost. This is what they do when you are at the AIM mail center I frequent. They suggest alternatives to save you money.  To HELP you, the customer, get the best service and rates. Not so here, they seemingly just want to maximize their profit. They went so far as to tell me that NO UPS Store would let me use my account. Which isn't true. At all. UPS wants small businesses to use the stores. So as far as service and helpfulness and all-around making my life as a small business owner easier, they did not meet the standards. I hope they take this criticism in the spirit it is given and make some changes. Helping a customer be successful is the key to their own success overall. Instead, they are simply trying to maximize their margins on every transaction, doing the customer a great disservice.","stars":1}

On multiple occasions he goes on and on about how much he hates it, and that he doesn't work at a dept. store. As soon as he saw I had an Amazon return, he took  other customers behind  me, and actually made me wait on purpose after he clearly stated he hates doing them. Goes on a bashing rant that he has no idea why UPS even does this. I thought the first time he may have just be having a bad day, but it's happened multiple times. Terrible customer service and blatantly rude on purpose.","stars":1}
{"text":"I am thoroughly disgusted by this store. We had 2 boxes to ship to California. First, the boxes weighed 59 pounds total together. They rang them up as 1 box at 60 pounds and the other st 152 pounds. Second, we called immediately upon opening to cancel. We were told it was canceled but was in Illinois and would be processed there and then come back. It took 2 weeks to get them back. Then we were told we would not receive any money back. So, they over charged based on weight. Plus, it was priced for shipment to California but never went that far. We should have gotten some money back but the manager Cliff is refusing to see the whole picture. There attorney general's office agrees with us and trying to help us. I have a friend that has driven for UPS for years and he's upset about this store. I called another store and they said they get complaints all the time about this store. Don't just trust them. Check your product weight and their receipts. I've included pictures so you can judge for yourself.","stars":1}

Especially the heavier set guy who stares at you when you walk in while sitting and on his phone! Not even a \"welcome in or how may I help?!\". He didn't even help and decided to chime in with an aggressive attitude shouting across the room when he had no right in the conversation. He then awkwardly stared at me from a distance.

I would have still hung out there and waited to pack and ship my $600 worth of packages, because I do prefer UPS generally, but, when I asked the man three times if there was a cart I could use without a response, I decided to drive 2 minutes down the road to Fedex office instead!","stars":1}

An individual who received some high quality alcoholic bottles in a shipment thought it would be great to share a shot or two with the woman working in the store.  This was a major red flag.  I understand this individual meant well, but does he understand that other customers were in the shop, and serving alcohol to workers working on the job probably violated company policies, and possibly state and county laws.  The woman were very responsible in telling this guy no, but he kept insisting and informed them that their boss said it was ok.  As a customer who rarely does business at this store, I must say that this incident is concerning. Drinking on the job is a no no and no customer should be opening alcohol and serving it to employees at a business such as this.","stars":4}

I said I wanted to just mail the evelope, nothing special and he again told me that the $10.29 was the cheapest cost.  After telling him that I was not an idiot and there is no way it cost this much, he came back with a little over a dollar.  REALLY, what the hell are they trying to do, uncharge to make money.

However, you may use our computer for a charge of $3.00 and an additional fee for each additional minute and print your own. \nI emphasized what Madewell's return instructions specifically stated that UPS would print the label.

If he had allergies, he would know that masks help to keep allergens out of the mouth, nose and lungs.  What is clear is that he doesn't care about his customers' health and safety or the laws for businesses in Pima County.

Whoever owns this store should be slapped with a 2x4 repeatedly. The staff of mainly ethnic women are really nice and helpful and that's the only reason for 2 stars. However, due to their price gouging I wont use this location for anything further.","stars":2}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this store a zero, but it doesn't allow it. I dropped off a package to be deliver on December 26, I was told that it will arrived on January 2. I tracked this package and it just showing it being dropped off to the this store, that date, and time. January 5th, I tracked again and it still shown the same thing. I came directly to the store and asked about it, the guy told me to call the customer service number because the package is no longer there and he didn't even care to go back and look for it. He said that the person that pick up my package did not scan the tracking. I called to the customer service and the lady told me that even if it's not scan there when it was picked up, when it arrived somewhere, someone would scan it, but it was never scanned. I'm sure someone in that store stole that package! So then I have no choice but have to do the lost package claim. Now is January 12th and it still have not arrived. PLEASE DO NOT MAIL ANYTHING HERE!!!!!!!!!! I wish whoever stole that package choked and died!","stars":1}
{"text":"I went into UPS Store # 6365, 1409 Marlton Pike E. Ste 168, Cherry Hill, NJ 08034 on April 4, 2018 to return a product via UPS Ground shipping. I came with the items to ship, and the label. Brenda was my cashier and she was very rude and resistant in assisting me with finding the appropriate packaging to ship these items. She had a very unprofessional attitude and was not helpful in this transaction at all. I have never been so unsatisfied with customer service in general and especially with UPS whom I ship with regularly both personally and in business. I am a very patient and fair minded person considering customer service is a significant role in my employment, but this was such an unpleasant experience that I felt obligated to ensure it was addressed and notify the manager and customer relations at UPS.\n\nI really am NOT that kind of person at all, this was my first time ever even sending a complaint for any product or service if that says anything.","stars":1}

I had printed the shipping label obnoxiously big on an 8.5 x 11, and the scanner code to go in the box. With the selfie pole, scanner code, and shipping label, I walked in and just kinda looked at the guy like, \"what next?\"\n\nHe must've seen this look of utter cluelessness in regards to Amazon returns before because he looked back at me with a surety, and told me I could just leave my stuff on the table. He charged me a measly $3ish to package, and said I was good to go. \n\nThis seemed terrifyingly quick in terms of shipment, just like when you bring your bags to the airport and the guy at the curbside counter is like, \"I got you, babe!\" and flips some labels on your bags and whisks them away without a word and a $5er in his pocket...and then you don't have any clothes when you get to Miami...\n\nBut enough about baggage. Mere days later, Amazon reassures me that they got my package and processed my refund. \n\nI don't advise holding your breath for this process, but it was incredibly painless in terms of time spent. I will definitely use this store for any future returns of other shameful purchases...Now to find a selfie pole with a remote...","stars":5}

I had the address provided by the employer (which did not contain a street address, only a building and zip code).  The owner waited on me and turned me away saying they couldn't send my package without a street address.  No offer to Google it or try to figure it out.  I went to the US post office who did offer help and discovered that the prospective employer (a university) had a zip code of their own and thus a street address was unnecessary.  I couldn't imagine that a package delivery company would turn anyone away wanting to mail a ....package.  Poor customer service!","stars":1}

First she told me to call back the next day and if it hadn't updated SHE would call UPS. I waited until the next day- and there was no update. So I called back like she suggested to seek out help that she offered. When I called the second time she told me that she couldn't help me. I didn't demand anything I asked you guys repeatedly for some customer service and for you to *ask* your driver that did the pick up (you said that it was the same driver) if he remembers the package, that was it  really a simple task. \n\nYou also tried to make it sound like I didn't bring the product packaged- I did. I did everything necessary on my end and still feel like you guys are severely lacking. \n\nTo call a customer belligerent amongst other things is completely asinine to do on a public forum. If my memory serves me right the gentlemen I spoke to wouldn't let me off the phone even though I told him several times I needed to go and that we were just going in circles. Do not paint me as the bad guy here- there is a learning curve for all parties involved here.","stars":1}

I hope that UPS is able to retain her and is compensating her as she deserves. It's rare to find someone like Monique, and too many companies don't value and recognize the talent that they have - particularly in a time where so many people would rather not work, show up, or do the best that they can do. UPS is lucky to have a true leader in Monique - who made her way to the Wayne location from Philadelphia to support us!\n\nShelley","stars":5}

One day later I get an email that they printed the labels and they have them ready for me but they are raising the prices to $5 standard charge + price per printed sheet.

{"text":"Wow.. that's all I have to say. Absolute WORST customer service ever! I shipped a pair of shoes from here and I told the girl I needed a box and to send it the least expensive trackable way. She charged me for the shipment and as I was about to leave I realized she was taping the shoebox up with the label on it. I asked her if she was going to put it in a box and she said no, it would be fine. I left feeling super uneasy about it since I've never seen anything shipped in the original box. Anything could have happened to the shoes! Despite my husband urging me to go back to have it shipped correctly I decided against it. Over a week later I still hadn't got the refund (and somehow managed to lose the receipt) so I call the location. I was on the phone for a half hour while they tried to locate the transaction. After finally finding it, they tell me that the tracking number would have been on the bottom of the receipt on a sticker. I KNEW this wasn't done but couldn't find the receipt to prove it. After searching high and low, just to prove them wrong, I found it. I took it in that same night to be sure that I was able to speak to the same woman I spoke with on the phone. Sure enough, no tracking number was added. All throughout the phone call the woman made sure to tell me that she didn't feel as though it was their fault, that I should keep my receipt. I told her I'm usually on top of things like that but with my wedding and an injury in the past couple weeks, it just wasn't at the forefront of my mind. Amazing customer service that is, blaming your paying customer multiple times. While in the office she also told me that the girl who rang me up was let go because she'd made too many errors.... this was after previously promising me that the girl would have done her job right because that's the way she was trained.. Also, upon asking what would happen if my package was lost, I was told it would just be my loss (!??!?!) They said they'd work with USPS to locate the package but that was just a line of bullarky because without a tracking number, that's never going to happen. Long story short, save your time, money, and frustration and take your package to a location that knows what they're doing because this place clearly has no clue and has absolutely NO customer service skills what-so-ever. Never again.","stars":1}

{"text":"Avoid.  If you need to ship an expensive item, go somewhere else.  The gross customer service I got here is enough to make me never to come here ever again, ever.  One star is perhaps a benevolent gift to this UPS location.\n\nMy handmade Espresso machine went on the blink and I had to send it back to the California manufacturer under warranty.  I got the return merchandise instructions which were to double wrap it in bubble and then place it in yet another box with more bubble.  All the packing requirements were printed and given to the store staff.  I did not pack it myself but gave it to the store employees and paid a handsome fee for the packing and shipping.  After being charged and the employee took charge of the equipment, I left assured the shipping requirements would be met.  \n\nA week later, the customer service representative from the Espresso Machine manufacturer called me and also sent me an email.  The machine was single-wrapped in thin cardboard and had obviously been dropped.  The machine frame was bent and had to be taken apart to put it into a new frame.  The total charges amounted to $970.  \n\nI immediately filed a claim against UPS and they sent their investigators to the California location.  After several weeks, the investigators called me with the finding that the damage had been caused by the UPS store franchise and not the UPS shipping company.  I then proceeded to file a claim against the store.  After two years, nothing but managers hiding behind their employees, not answering calls, emails or any other diligence on their part.  \n\nThis disaster of a UPS store reflects poorly against the entire company. But as a franchise, UPS and the franchisee can point fingers at each other to deny proper customer service.\n\nMy angst is not with UPS itself as they performed quite well.  As a matter of fact, after the initial Yelp writeup, I got calls from Hq UPS.  They investigated it twice and came to the same conclusion, that the packer was at fault and it was my fight against the store.\n\nWorst customer service ever.","stars":1}

UPS Store, you weighed my package, measured my package, had the address and customs paperwork and quoted me a price. \nA mistake was made on UPS store's part and they let $16 ruin any future business. \nHere is what UPS Store should have done. Sent my package and paid the difference in postage to make sure the delivery happened in a timely manner as promised. \nSecond, after fulfilling their obligations to our agreement they could have negotiated with me to see if I would pay the difference. \nThird and most importantly they, UPS Store should never leave a new employee alone to run business.

When I walked in, both associates were yelling and joking back and forth while a customer waited to be called to the desk. When I finally got to the front of the line, I also waited while one of the guys seemingly did nothing. When I was helped by the other associate, I was met with nothing short of derision, sarcasm, and a complete lack of customer service. He didn't offer me options for shipping, ignored instructions for a second shipment, which almost got shipped out without the correct label, and then muttered grumpily to himself when I tried to correct the situation. I took my last package and went to FedEx. I won't be visiting this particular UPS store ever again.","stars":1}

Over the phone I was given one price and told I didn't need to bring a CD or thumb drive, but when I got there a different staff member was working and I was told two different price options and that I'd need to come back with my own thumb drive or memory card... frustrating. \n\n3 stars still, because the shipping went well and I love that they're so convenient in Gretna.","stars":3}

{"text":"They REPEATEDLY lie to you about the cheapest method - one time trying to charge me $17 more than necessary.  I have had to ask multiple times about UPS ground rate (which I knew walking in the door) after they quoted a much higher price.  Even when I did finally get them to use UPS ground, it was $2.50 more than it should be and I was also overcharged (vs advertised price) for the box I bought there. \n\nThey also lie to you about excessive charging for services being UPS fault.  I can send a two page document to be printed via UPS to that same store for 18 cents. If you don't pay online they want to charge you $2 for two sheets of simple black/white printing which happened to be the UPS shipping label.  I asked them why it was $2.00 instead of $0.18 - the owner kept saying UPS makes me charge that amount. I asked is it cheaper if I go online (he didn't realize I did that before either).  He said no - he is forced to charge that amount.  Not so at all.  It was all him lying.  \n\nThe UPS Store owner will take advantage of you if you don't know the rates and don't know what your options are.  I have no trust in this store.\n\nI never thought I would say this but my experience was far, far, far better at our local Post Office.  The guy there helped me fit my item into a smaller box - saving me money.  \n\nIt is a shame as I love UPS and have never had issues with any UPS managed shipping center,  but these UPS stores are privately owned so while it isn't UPS that is lying/cheating, it does negatively affect my wanting to ship via UPS.   Since UPS is a fine company - find another store to ship from - you will save yourself quite a bit of money and not feel cheated every time you walk in the door.","stars":1}

{"text":"I would give this place -10 stars if I could. That's saying a lot. Earlier this year I moved from Nashville to Los Angeles and needed to ship a few boxes before I left. I paid about $600 to ship 5 boxes, which yes, it's expensive, but I needed my things so I didn't really have a choice. It wasn't an issue. I had them shipped to a UPS in Los Angeles because they were arriving before me, and I didn't want them sitting at an empty house. A few days later I got a notification that the UPS in Los Angeles was sending my packages back. Of course I called them immediately asking what happened, they said they can't keep any packages without getting a heads up first because it was such a small facility. They also said they already shipped out my packages, but that the UPS store I shipped them from would be able to redirect them. (Obviously I would have been more than happy to make a two minute phone call to let them know my packages were coming, but I was never told to call them). So I called the UPS in Nashville and explained what happened. They told me they were redirecting my packages and I would get them at my Los Angeles house in a few days. A few days later, I got a notification that my packages arrived in Nashville. I immediately called the store asking what happened since they told me they redirected them, and they told me it was too late for them to redirect. So I kindly asked them to ship my packages back to LA, and they told me I had to pay to ship them again. I can't even begin to explain how frustrated I was. 1- I was never told to let the LA UPS know my packages were coming, that's not my fault. 2- They're now asking me to pay ANOTHER $600 and 3- They told me my packages were redirected and never called me back to let me know it was too late. I was so calm and nice asking what I can do to work this out with them. I was speaking directly with the manager, Chris, who was there when I was originally shipping everything out. He said there was nothing he can do, I don't have a choice but to pay for it again, and refused to give me his boss's contact information. Now, I understand paying for shipping again if it was $50. But $600?! TWICE?! Over a mistake that wasn't mine? I begged them to work with me, give me a partial refund, something. But they absolutely refused. I ended up having to pay $1200 for my 5 boxes to get to LA, which, by the way, when they got here were so incredibly damaged, and everything inside the boxes was broken as well. Matter fact, 3 of the 5 boxes were put INSIDE of other boxes, because they were falling apart so much. I'm not joking when I say I would pay someone to use FedEx instead of UPS and I will never use UPS again in my life. I feel sorry for anyone who has had the displeasure of working with Chris, and who knows how many other customers he has screwed over & refused to give his boss's contact information to after doing so. At this point, not even a full refund would fix what I have gone through dealing with these people and their idiocy. And let me just say - I feel genuinely sorry for whoever owns this UPS because they probably don't even know how their customers are treated.","stars":1}

She then proceeded to get an outrageous attitude when I requested a receipt. This kind of childish behavior continued through the entire interaction.

Once the label I printed wasn't able to be scanned and they wanted to charge me $5 to reprint a label because their scanner couldn't read it.  Couldn't they just type the numbers in the system for free?  I wouldn't have been as upset about the $5 if it didn't come with attitude.  And this issue was pre-COVID-19, so they cannot use it as an excuse.\n\nHonestly, it is close to me so I will continue to drop things off there.

{"text":"This location is small, but seems to offer all of the services found at any other UPS Store. As this plaza is near my office, and on my commute, I frequently ship my packages & bulky envelopes here. I usually use the cheaper USPS postage, but occasionally I need a signature or at least a tracking number, so in those instances, I use UPS Ground. I really appreciate the tracking info I get via email!\n\nSometimes I need color copies &/or laminating, and while the prices are not really competitive with large runs at a print house, the turn-around time is almost always within 48 hours, and often same day. Typically, I'm not given much lead time, yet this UPS Store can usually meet my tight deadlines. I really like being able to email my short-run print jobs so I only need to go in the store when my print is ready.\n\nThe store's owner is \"the Asian woman\" mentioned in other reviews. She is Japanese, and has owned this store for at least 15 years (maybe longer). She is also usually the only one of her staff that is a notary, so I call ahead when I need that service to make sure she will be there. The other employees I've encountered have been friendly & helpful as well.\n\nThe plaza is rather nondescript, although it has a traffic light. Yet with a couple of restaurants (including Ken's Sushi that I still want to try), an apparently popular animal hospital, plus a bunch of other businesses, it's a very busy plaza. Parking is tight, mainly because the \"thru lane\" doesn't feel quite wide enough with all the vehicle traffic coming & going. Backing up with my giant minivan involved a lot of looking around, and even with my smaller SUV, I still feel like I'm squeezing in here, so I try to park on the side facing Gulf to Bay. That said, I have never had to park far away from the store, so available spaces are sufficient.","stars":5}

My last visit (3/9/2021) was the most outrageous visit yet. A new employee was struggling terribly with processing the three small padded envelopes I was trying to send out. Everyone has a difficult first several days on the job so I wasn't upset at all with her - until she asked for help from the other employee manning the front desk. This employee seemed a little more seasoned - but maybe only by a couple of months. She had an absolutely awful grasp at what \"customer service\" means, interpreting it as an opportunity to talk to me very slowly and deliberately but firmly - kind of like how someone would talk to a disobedient child. I was being extraordinarily patient with the employee I was working with and when I finally reached a level of exasperation that I had to ask if everything was \"OK\" and that all I needed to do was mail these three pre-addressed envelopes this second employee got involved like she was ready to do battle. I left feeling really confused by how things went so wrong in there. Unable to resist, as I walked out the door to go to the post office she loudly issued a \"have a blessed day\" that was loaded with insincerity and sarcasm you - a parting shot, just for good measure, to get in that last little dig on me. The whole interaction was really out of control and it was not the first time I've had trouble with this particular UPS Store. One employee acts so sullen and bored and \"so done\" with Life in general that you have to worry if your package will arrive in one piece because she's asleep at the wheel every time you go in there. This place is rife with personnel and customer service issues and if you actually care about what you are sending out and it getting there without incident I would suggest the UPS Store at the Edmonson Pike and Old Hickory Boulevard intersection.","stars":1}

Well I needed to print business cards and their in-store POS advertising even says they print business cards - but nope. I was told they don't do that. They can send it out but it will take more than 5 days, but they do not do it as advertised. Then I just needed some pages printed on card stock and possibly bound together. I needed it cut down to a different size than standard 8.5x11, but I was told their paper cutter was broken. Then after waiting over half an hour in the store I was told they could not print anything because their printers were not working. What an incredible waste of time.

{"text":"**respond to comment below:\nTo start, I would like to mention that Dave, the store manager, gave me a call and was very very helpful about trying to get this issue resolved. I really appreciated his help. It seems like some information just slipped through the cracks during this entire process. \n\nI want to clarify a few things:\nMy mother physically came into the store to notify the delay 1-2 days after it happened. So someone must have missed notifying the central UPS. The notification they sent promptly outside of the 15 day window time frame was the one I made because we never got the promised check that the associate said would have been mailed in 3 weeks. So when 3 weeks passed, I was already outside the 15-day time frame to notify the delay... Which all seems very unfair.\n\nI also don't understand this notifying the store within the 15-day time frame policy. I know the store did not make this policy... But I just find it so odd that obviously, they made a mistake, but somehow throw the responsibility back to the customer for notifying them? Everyone in the system is aware that the shipment was made late... Every associate in the store and the people on the other end of the 1800 number was able to see that the shipment was made after the promised date... So why have this 15-day policy? UPS made the mistake, but now we can't get a refund because we did not notify them, even though they know they did wrong. But this is all irrelevant anyway because my mother did come in 1-2 days after understanding that there was a delay. But now it's going to turn into a whole ordeal because there is no record that she came into the store and I don't know what the store will do to resolve this. \n\nI tried to contact Dave over the weekend but he was not available... So I will try again sometime this week. Hopefully, there will be a resolution to this. \n\n**original review:\nMy mother paid for 2 day shipping on February 28, 2017 to send out important documents but it got delivered after 2 days. She gave the store a call and they promised to give her full refund in form of a mailed check. That never came in... So I had to call to follow up (since my mother lives out of the country), and again, they promised they will mail the refund. Once more, that never came in. So here I am in June calling the store again, and the person who picked up says he will call me back to see what's going on. At this point, I have no more patience with this store and just assume no one can do their jobs. I called the ups 1800 number and the lady who picked up looked into the order and said that no one ever made a refund request for that order (so I'm not sure if there's something wrong with their system or the 2 people just never completed their promise) Unfortunately she cannot help me beyond that and just gave me another 1800 number to call (ugh)  I'm about to do that now and fingers crossed I finally get the promised refund... Anyways, this has been SUCH  a frustrating experience. Granted everyone has been super polite and nice, but not helpful at all.","stars":1}

If you're looking for a one-stop-spot to handle all packages then UPS would be the way to go. Otherwise go to USPS half a mile away on Big Bend Blvd.","stars":4}

You need some shipping then I would definitely come here even if it is out of the way because it will save time and it's worth. Thank you!!\nJRB","stars":5}

{"text":"Good God this is such a beautiful space! And a counter full of tasty treats! This place is a little different because the pastries are laid out on a counter, not under glass, not behind a sneeze-guard. They're all right there in front of you to smell and examine with yer eyes. (No, they don't just give you what's on the counter. You get your items fresh.) But it's a unique marketing concept. \n\nWhen we visited, we had just had lunch at home, so I didn't try any of their meal items. I had a cinnamon molasses cookie and Tricia had a peanut butter. Both were delicious, and pretty reasonable at a buck fifty each. The cakes in the glass case are eye-poppingly gorgeous, with smaller cupcake size portions you can buy at a smaller price (around $5.50 a cupcake, which sounds high, but may be completely worth it.)\n\nIt looks like homemade ice cream will be coming shortly.

Although I've gotten used to packing light, there are times when I either want to buy things and send them ahead or send stuff I don't need back in advance of the travel.  Places like the UPS store, or even it's close counterparts, work quite well if there's no USPS nearby. \n\nI came across this UPS store while looking for a competitor.   Although staying at a hotel that did not offer a mailing service for large packages, I was fortunate to be at a hotel near the convention center.    I knew I could count on finding something.  The store itself took a while to locate as there were no maps in the CC of available services, but a helpful guard directed me to the right spot.   This store is near the middle of the CC at the door facing Higgins Drive.  What I found was a typical UPS mailing store with a copy machine and copy services, mailing supplies and services, a helpful employee, and not much of a line on a weekend with no major event in the center. \n\nThis particular location has varied hours depending on what's happening, so be sure to check the website to find the hours","stars":3}

The store has other benefits, too, such as purchasing boxes, envelopes, stamps, etc., to essentially complete all your mailing needs. It's quite spacious for just a mailing store. It's a bit hard to see, though, because it's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall; really only noticeable by the small, glowing UPS sign. The best way to know you're in the right location is by the Marsh next to it. If you want to mail a package, here you go!","stars":4}

When I brought it back the first time, he told me first that I could not return a product that had been opened (how would you know it's defective, then?), and then that I was just using it wrong.  He tightened the wheel on the tape dispenser and sent me on my way.\n\nAn hour or so later, my wife was using the tape gun to tape up a box and the wheel shattered.  When I tried to bring it back today and explain what had happened, he refused to listen, accused me of breaking the tape gun intentionally (for reasons that made no sense), and threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave.

He offered no help, did not offer to call for me, offered nothing. I asked if he could call the hub for me and check on the package. Nope, nothing. I used to be a supervisor for a UPS Store in Texas, and if I had treated a customer that way, I would not be employed there for any length of time. As an UPS store employee, one is able to call UPS for customers, as a service, and help them with their packages or tracking issues.

{"text":"I never write reviews, but after my first (and most certainly last) visit to this store, I felt it was necessary.  I guess I wasn't surprised when I saw other reviews of the same nature.  First of all, I work for an office downtown and employees in my office have used this UPS store for shipping purposes in the past.  I had a box with a prepaid label to ship and went to pick it up from my car which was parked several blocks away from my office (the package itself probably wasn't larger than approx. 18\" by 22\" in diameter, however, it was very heavy.  Because I had picked it up from my car, I didn't have any tape to close the box and my packing tape gun was back at my office, so I kindly asked the man behind the corner if he could tape the top.  He informed me it would be $1.10.  I honestly thought he was joking.  I told him I didn't have my wallet with me and I thought it was pretty absurd he would charge me for a small strip of tape anyway.  He then went on to say how tape costs money and he would lose money if he didn't charge everyone, blah blah blah.  As I was about to pick up my box and take it back to my office so I could tape it closed, he reluctantly agreed to put one strip of tape across the top if I would come back and pay him.  Of course, just for the principle of it, I will never set foot in that store again and I will tell anyone else who does business there not to unless they want to deal with this rude man.  Fortunately, there is another UPS store a few blocks away that I will gladly use.","stars":1}

{"text":"I've been using UPS to ship all my packages for as a long as I can remember. Recently, I relocated to Washington and my Dad decided to ship my 55' TV to me for Christmas as a surprise. He asked UPS to make sure it was packaged correctly, and the guy insisted he would -- you'd think he would since he works at UPS. When I got my TV it was shattered into pieces. This was literally a 55' TV that it was labeled so on the front. Why would you toss a box that is clearly labeled as a 55' TV? \n\nI then had to call UPS to set up an incident since my Dad had insured the TV for $500. UPS said they would come and \"investigate.\" Without contacting me, UPS kept stopping by and tried to get the TV. I got to my last notice of pick up and decided to stay home since I have no way of transporting a 55' TV. If you can believe it, the guy did not come during the time allotted. Surprise. When he did come he was rude and would not help me move the TV. So, I took my 4 foot 11 inches self and pushed with all my might as he watched me struggle. He took it and left, giving me my claim number. \n\nUPS never got in touch with me. I finally called one day after 3 weeks to check on the progress of their \"investigation.\" They said it had been closed weeks ago and sent back to Arizona (to the store it had been sent from). What?! No one even bothered to tell me it had been closed or that they were refusing to pay the insurance. \n\nI informed my Dad and he went to the store to retrieve my broken TV with his receipt showing a charge that had been processed for packaging, but later came to find that the man at the store had never charged him for packaging, even though my father was certain he had paid for it. \n\nIt's clear the package was not packaged as it was, but we were deceived into thinking that it had been. Regardless, how do you break such a large item? Why not take proper care? \n\nI will never ship with UPS again, nor will any of my family members. Not only did they not take proper care with my package, but the manager at the store made it seem like all would be fine, and then the customer service with the \"investigation team\" is a joke. It doesn't help that the week before this incident UPS lost an item that my sister attempted to ship me. I know it was the holidays and all, but seriously, where's the justice here?","stars":1}

The only reason that a shipping label should cost $1.15 is when UPS prints a self-adhesive label: I just made 4 copies, and taped one label to the package, myself.

If something arrives with no box number on it, no worries: the figure it out,\n\nThe downside is that they're kind of spendy. I think the price for the smallest mailbox has gone up almost every year. They advertise AAA+AARP discounts, but that turns out to be only for the first year. I think they give me a break on price sometimes for faxes and copies. The small family mailbox place I used charged half the prince for the box (there was a shipping surcharge). At UPS, paying almost $200/year for similar (though less personal) service at a PO (where there are no mailing surcharges), makes me think every year that it I may gat a PO Box year instead -- once I close my business at least,","stars":4}

{"text":"So expecting a package? About half the time, you won't find a slip in your box for a few days after it was delivered. But wait, the tracking number said it was delivered and signed for yesterday? Oh, that's right, they will leave your package on the floor close to the back entrance and get around to organizing them when they feel like it. That is of course if someone doesn't just walk off with it (this hasn't happened to me, but I see a serious risk here with this setup).\n\nHow about magazine subscriptions - you have any of those? Good luck with that. Half the time your mags just won't show up, the other half of the time they show up a week late. Since I receive a few subscriptions and noticed that I hadn't had a weekly magazine for about a month, I inquired one day (like WTF?). As it would turn out, they leave them stacked in boxes in the back, until once again, they feel like sorting through them. In the meantime, the store employees will be sitting on the counter or shooting the sh!t on the phone, but they can't be disturbed to do their jobs.\n\nGenerally the employees are nice, but c'mon here....","stars":1}
{"text":"I hate shipping. If I need to ship something fragile, I take it here.\n\nThe people are nice, and although they always have a television blaring when you walk in, if you go in at the right time of day, you can catch a talk show and find out if Gomer sitting on the chair is or is not the father, but I digress. \n\nAlthough it can be pricey, things always arrive in the condition in which I left them, and I have yet to have any issues with the service. \n\nWarning, ask when they will actually ship the item if you are in a hurry, because sometimes it takes them a couple days to package large and or fragile items. I don't understand why it takes a couple days, but they say that it does.\nThis location takes credit cards. The one in Gretna does not.","stars":3}

Kept cutting me off and telling me to call UPS directly, which made no sense to me.  Tried to explain it was a person to person shipment and not something that was originated by UPS.  He was having no part of it.  So I called UPS and they told me that it was easy and I did not need UPS to do it.  Said I would call him back and say that, but of course got Voice mail again.  I said forget it and I called another UPS store (2817 W End Ave) further away from where I was staying.  Spoke to Sierra, who was awesome, and she said....\"sure send away\" and gave me instructions on how to do it.  They charge $5 to receive.

I went home and taped it - it took exactly 14\" of package tape.  At the rate the UPS store wanted to charge, that would have meant a normal roll of packing tape would have been in excess of $40.

{"text":"While I was traveling in New Orleans, my son called from his work and urgently needed a notarized authorization letter from me.  I found this UPS store which offered notary public and FAX.  When I walked in there were 3 people busy working. I stood in front of the counter for more than 5 minutes before a man (whom I think was the owner) finally waited on me. \n\nI got the letter notarized and they FAXed it for me.  After several minutes, my son still didn't receive the fax.  The man showed me the FAX log to prove it was successfully sent and asserted the receiving end was the problem.  However my son said the machine in his office was working because it had several FAXes came in during this time.  After 15 minutes the FAX was still not received.  The UPS man retrieved the FAX job from the machine's memory and resent it.  Another 10 minutes went by, my son still didn't receive the FAX.  Now the owner said nothing he could do about it.  I decided to take a picture of the letter with my mobile and texted it to my son.  Fortunately the picture was accepted by the staff my son was dealing with.\n\nLater my son figured out what was going on by checking the sending phone #'s of the jobs coming into his machine.  The UPS store did FAX but they sent wrong file (someone's inventory) from their computer.  When they re-sent, the same file was sent again.  Both my son and I wasted 30 minutes of our time and $2.50 FAX fee for nothing. \n\nAlso I think the $20 notary fee was pretty high.  The several UPS stores in my town charge only $2 per page!","stars":1}

{"text":"I have gone to this UPS store 4 times in the past year. I do a lot of shipping as I have an ebay store. My preference is shipping via the Post Office, but a few times I needed to ship before they closed and this UPS store in the Publix shopping center at Bootranch in Palm Harbor was closest to me. Anyway each time I went to this UPS store, the owner (a very aggressive and not so nice man) tried to convince me to ship via UPS instead of USPS as I asked. When he quoted the prices I was appalled. UPS franchisee's make a nice profit on their business and I don't believe there is a cap on what they can charge. USPS is a government run agency with a cap on what they can charge, so they would make much less profit when a customer ships via USPS.\n\nThe first 3 times I visited this particular store, I felt as though I was almost being forced to ship via UPS and I left the store without shipping my package, because I was so upset that I wasn't being treated fairly and certainly not like a valued customer. I even told the owner that each time I come here there is a problem when I ask to ship USPS. \n\nThe last time I visited this store, I was desperate and had to ship that day or I would miss my ebay shipping deadline.This time, I was being \"helped\" by a younger man who I assume is the owner's son or grandson, because he had the exact same aggressive and forceful manner and was trying to convince and force me to ship UPS. He actually said these words to me, \"If I were you I would definitely not ship USPS\" I asked why and he said, \"because you won't get your money back if the package is lost\" I said, \"USPS lost a package of mine last year and I was paid $200 thiirty days after that\" He said, \"Really, USPS had lost dozens of my packages and I have never received my money back\" That is obviously not true, but I was afraid that if I shipped USPS, they would \"lose\" my package, so I shipped it UPS and paid $11.00 more than I would have if I had gone to the Post Office. That is RIDICULOUS. I have dealt with other UPS stores in the past and  have NEVER treated this way before or been forced to ship UPS and I have NEVER seen the prices jacked up that high. This place is despicable and I will NEVER go there again, NO MATTER WHAT. I feel as though they should be investigated for shady business practices. Stay away from this place if you want to be treated fairly and save some money!","stars":1}

Obviously regular mail wasn't going to cut it. Then, I had the genius idea to throw all of the cards into one giant envelope and send it via UPS or FedEx. Yeah, it would cost a lot, but it would get there in time! I googled the nearest FedEx (my preferred shipment provider) but would have to drive across one of the bridges to Elmood or Tchoupitoulas. UPS had a location in Harvey - yay!\n\nThere was one customer ahead of me in line taking forever, but luckily, they had 2 people working at this location. The service was quick but quite subpar. Maybe I've been spoiled by FedEx. Anyhow, he asked for my address and the address for the shipment. Even though I spelled everything out, he still ended up typing part of both addresses incorrectly. I would think that verifying, in print/writing, before submitting the shipment would be a good idea? Maybe I'm being too logical. I didn't receive anything to check the spelling for errors until he gave me the receipt.\n\nHe also never asked when I wanted it to arrive. Again, maybe it's that I'm used to FedEx, but they always give me options... earlier arrival = higher cost. In this case, I would have probably chosen the most expensive/fastest option anyway, but it would have been nice to at least have options.\n\nThis would have received a 2 star review, but apparently despite the spelling errors and whatnot, the cards did arrive at my mother's house today.

{"text":"Please update your store hours. Both the ups and yelp websites say 6:30. I pulled up at 6:01 carrying a huge box, the door was locked, and the guy behind the counter ignored me. The sign on the front said they closed at 6:00 but every presence online said 6:30. Again, do us a favor and correct your store hours.","stars":1}

{"text":"I've never felt so compelled to write a review- let alone a negative one. This shop charged me $8 to DROP OFF a box with a prepaid shipping label. What does the $8 cover? They tape the box and print out a receipt. To clarify:\n\n1. I brought my box in to this UPS shop with a prepaid shipping label attached. \n2. They charged me $8 to tape the box and print out a receipt. \n\nAvoid at all costs.","stars":1}
{"text":"At the present time, it may be a little difficult to find this location due to the renovations being carried our in the strip center where they are located.

The transaction went smoothly.  I would definitely recommend this location if your using UPS.","stars":4}
{"text":"I have a mailbox at this store. They have always been great notifying me of packages and having them ready when I get there. I've shipped packages both self-packed and that they packed. Earlier this year a package I shipped got lost and I couldn't find my receipt for shipping only for packing materials around that day.

However, when a very rude woman came to help him with my order, she rang up charges that I didn't approve, or even understand.  I had two packages, and I had to purchase both boxes. Which she charged me for, no problem! Then she charged me $1.99 per box for tape. Tape on 2 boxes costs almost $4 at this store.  I did not have any packing material or peanuts put in my boxes.  This was a cost for tape to close the boxes.  I said that I thought that was pretty steep for tape, and she says, \"That's what we charge!\" So they got my $4, and I hope that they don't get yours!","stars":1}

{"text":"UPS was my last hope in getting a book of letters from loved ones created for my husband-to-be on our wedding day. I have always used Staples in the past and after my order sat there for a month, was printed wrong and then I was told it would not be done on time (when I dropped off months before wedding), I was so upset and turned to UPS to see if they could assist. (I had already dealth with 3 Staples stores). THEY SAVED THE DAY. Tracy was very unerstanding of what I wanted created, very timely in getting me a proof and understood my now time-crunch. She knocked it out of the park. This book was perfect- full color, the pictures were clear and beautiful and she even had a sleeve made for cover. My husband was elated and so thankful for such a cherished gift. If it wasn't for Tracy and her compassion and willingness, that gift would never have come to be.

He refused to take a USPS package (even though his store website says he should take these). Then, for the UPS package I had, he made me package the label and do everything myself... then told me I did it wrong... Every other UPS store I have been to, I have been able to just drop these packages with their labels on the counter and leave. Will not be back.

{"text":"Dropped off 3 chairs to be shipped. My first mistake, I left the store w out a bill of lading. I was promised an email containing the BOL and all pertinent info. Had to call twice asking for the BOL. Eventually, Tracy Umeda sent the promised info via email . I was assured , The chairs were to be shipped that Thursday or Friday, with an arrival no later than Tuesday the following week. \n I callled on Tuesday and they couldn't tell me where the chairs were, if they had even shipped! Eventually they found them still in Nash in a warehouse. There were several excuses as to why they hadn't shipped, Weather  was reasonable but why they didn't know where the chairs were, know if they had shipped or not, and why they were still in a warehouse in Nashville is unacceptable. \n I was tempted to cancel the order but Tracy Umeda, the manager, promised me she would stay on top of it, ensure they shipped and would let me know the status the next day. With no phone call from Tracy for 2 days I called. Her excuse this time was that Comcast phones went out the day she suppose to call and that   She had been too busy to call once the phones were operating. Never really got an answer as to why she couldn't email me.\nAt this point, the chairs are enroute. Hopefully they arrive and are still in tact. \nNot worth the time, money and hassle. This store  Has more excuses than a bad tenant when rent is due.","stars":1}
{"text":"This is like any other UPS store with one exception. The employees here just don't care. Either their Dad owns the franchise or they are all rich. My most recent visit had to wait around for 10 minutes in a store with more employees than customers. Shipped several items for rush shipping. An hour after I left the store, they called my friend who also shipped items to report they found one of his items on the floor and forgot to pack it.","stars":1}
{"text":"Service has improved!\nI have been a customer for over a year now. The operating owner/ managers have noticed and recognize the returning customers. \nThey have been pleasant with several returned products and have provided amicable service. \nThey have taken the time to explain my rental box renewal process (I have not decided to renew as of yet) and have not rushed me even when busy or closing.

{"text":"This location lost my package in their store a couple of weeks ago. They blamed the UPS driver for possibly keeping the package on their truck to reattempt delivery. The associate claimed \"this has been happening a lot lately, give it a couple days and see if it arrives at your house.\" They took a copy of my info notice and my phone number and said they would contact me by the end of day if they found my package. They never contacted me. A couple of days later I called the location, an associate stated they couldnt't locate my package and that the owner is trying to resolve it with UPS, he's on break right now, and will call you in an hour or so. I never received a call. At this point I'm really upset and trying to be patient because it's busy during X-mas time and I come here a lot and never had issues in the past. I know the UPS guy who delivers in my area and spoke to him the next day and he said, \"If the system says I dropped the package off and I gave you an access point location to pick your package, they have it.\" He even looked up the delivery and said the owner Fred signed for it. I needed this package soon before Xmas because I was going to be out the country and wanted to give people their gifts before I left. According to the voicemail they left, which came through well after Xmas due to me being out the country,  they didn't find my package until Xmas eve. I returned to the store a couple of days later to return other orders. A different associate informed me that they contacted me several times about my package (in an impliacative tone of this being my fault). I told him I received the messages when I came back to the country, which was already too late, my vendor took care of the situation. What REALLY pissed me off is the fact that this company put me through all this BS and had the nerve to charge me packaging fees and fees to access a label on their computer to return a few items. I'm sorry, this is a franchised store, and to keep a loyal customer returning, the fees could've been waived, that was definitely within their power. I understand companies have to make money, but sometimes common sense and discretion is needed when you want to keep repeating customers. Although the situation was resolved with my vendor, I didn't like the way this UPS store handled the situation. They've definitely lost a loyal customer.","stars":1}
{"text":"In late June I had called around to a few other shipping businesses to get prices to ship a small box to Las Vegas where my daughter was at on vacation. Everyone was outragous in prices (upwards of $60 at one place), so I called my local UPS store here on Damonte Ranch Parkway to ask for rates. Andrew answered the phone with amazing customer service. I told Andrew what my package was and asked if he could give me a rate, he was so great at helping me! He got me the rate right over the phone and very nicely told me that there was only 15 minutes left till the last truck of the day left, but assured me if I got there he would take care of me! I live only 5 minutes away from the store, so I jumped in my car and headed down. When I got there, there was 3 people in line ahead of me. I was concerned becuase Andrew was there all by himself, later I found out that his supervisor was on vacation and his coworker called out for the day, and I was worried my package would not reach my daughter. Let me tell you how impressed I was! Andrew was amazingly sweet and speedy with every customer, his multi tasking skills were through the roof! He was answering phones, weighing packages, helping customers, dealing with drivers, all at the same time and everything was running so smooth! He helped the people in front of me, and when I came to the counter he saw the destination on the package he realized I was the one who had called a few moments ago, and he was just the best! I have never seen anyone give customer service like that before!! Andrew is the reason I will ship with UPS from now on!! What a great guy to have working for your company!! 5 stars all the way around!","stars":5}

{"text":"My wife and I shop on Amazon a lot, and fairly often need to do a return.  We used to go to our local Staples, and they did a great job.  Even if I just brought something in unpackaged, they would happily package it up, attach the printed label, and off it went.  Well, unfortunately our Staples closed, and a few days ago I had to go to the UPS Store (4636 Lebanon Pike, Hermitage, TN 37076).  This was an entirely different experience.  When you enter, there are signs everywhere that say you have to pay $1.00 if you didn't bring packing tape.  \n\nSo I had everything boxed up, but it did need one swipe of tape across the top.  An older man who worked there said, \"Do you have tape?\"  I said, \"No.  Staples always used to tape it for us.\"  He said, \"No, they charged for it too.  They had signs up.\"  I said, \"Well, they never charged me.\"  He rather obnoxiously said, \"Well, lucky you.\"  \n\nYou get the idea from the moment you walk in that they don't like doing returns.  I let Amazon know about this too, because maybe having this store do their returns isn't a great fit.  As an online store, Amazon relies on customers' being able to feel that their return process will be simple and easy.  Personally, I don't intend to set foot in this store again, so I feel a little less able to easily return packages to Amazon now.\n\nIf I had a business like this one, I would encourage my employees to say, \"Oh, you didn't realize that was our policy?  Well, this one's free, but just be aware of that in the future.\"  Or better yet, I probably wouldn't charge customers for a piece of tape at all.","stars":2}

{"text":"To: Jeff Day (Owner of UPS Store 5220)\n\nDon't you think if Mary knew the procedure to handle a Amazon return I would have utilized your services? The truth is she didn't want to deal with the mattress I was returning because it was a hassle and you weren't making a \"profit off the return\". Because, I have nothing better to do at 8:30am in the morning than unload a queen size mattress alone (no help from your employees) and the drag it back to my truck and struggle to get it back into the truck because your employees are incompetent. It wasn't about paying for a $2 label, that would have been a no brainer, you got to do better than that. Making up bullshit to make me look like the bad guy and you the victim eh? UPS IS UPS, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT LOCATION I CALL, UPS IS THE CURRIER FOR AMAZON.\nMary was ok with shipping it, but as soon as I said I needed a Amazon return label, She played dumb like a new employee, hence it was supposed to be free return service to customers if they received the wrong product, like I did.\nShe made me wait 20 minutes even though I was the 1st customer in line while she helped everyone else. I even showed her the barcode for the return label on my smart phone so she could scan it and print the label but she said verbatim \"I don't know how to do that\"...haha\nShe wanted me to log onto your computers and rack up internet fees, and the printing fee when it wasn't necessary. All she had to do is scan my phone and print the label and boom I would have been gone and on my way to work.\nThe truth is,  she didn't want to deal with a big queen sized mattress in the store and you weren't making a profit on the shipment. Let's call it what it is. \nAs for rude comments, I called her inappropriate and a few choice words given the situation.\nIf you value Mary as much as you say you do (20 years) why don't you pay her grumpy ass a bit more so she looks happy and enthusiastic to help customers. Isn't that what UPS prides itself in?\nAs far as not being allowed back, dude I wouldn't use your services to ship my dogs fecal sample to the vet, if it was free!\n\nIf you want to see an example of UPS quality, walk into the Broadway/Campbell location and take notes, bring Mary too;)\nI have never made a bad Yelp review ever, but you and your employee need ethics training because what you did to me was totally avoidable.","stars":1}

{"text":"This place is truly awful. I had to deposit a check and the system was down so I waited a very long time. Fine, things like that happen. But I was there for almost an hour so I got to watch the employees interact with customers. Unbelievably unprofessional behavior. The gentleman helping me was fine, but the other women working just kept leaving and going into the back of the store - while customers were waiting. At one point I heard them arguing about money in the back! They also had a customer on speakerphone talking with him about his mailbox (including the contents). I am letting USAA know and I will also be contacting UPS directly.","stars":1}
{"text":"This store is listed as a UPS i Parcel Service pick-up point, little do people know that this isn't actually a UPS corporate store, they are an authorized retailer that make up their own rules and pricing.  I was charged a $10 \"holding fee\" and for a service that should have cost any extra.  I was told if I didn't pay the fee that they would mark my package as abandoned.  Basically paid a ransom to get my package back.  Do not ship your packages here unless you wanna pay their extra fees.","stars":1}

{"text":"Real people, real good service.\n\nWhat makes one UPS store different from another or for that matter from any other package store?  It's the people and the service.  After using this outfit for many years I have to say of the half dozen or so I have used this is as good as it gets. Friend, fast, courteous and just a pleasant experience overall.  I have all my business correspondence and packages sent in and out of this shop.  They do all they can to be helpful and save me time.  And you can get groceries, gas, and booze and have lunch right in the same shopping center!","stars":5}

{"text":"I have used this location for many years, and have always found their service to be extraordinary. I usually use it for my Amazon returns about 5 times a year. I have never had a problem until last week. I dropped off my returns, and a woman named Jennifer was quite rude. She spoke down to me like I was a child (I am a mid-40's executive who happened to be dressed down that day and can look young) and kept talking over me to explain how Amazon returns work. She then told me that I needed to purchase the tape to seal the boxes. I explained that I have never had to do that before in all of my years of coming to that particular location, so I refused to make that purchase. She then charged me to tape up the 3 boxes, telling me that it was to keep \"people from abusing the system.\" *Blank stare* The proper customer service etiquette would have been for her to tell me that since I haven't paid in the past, she wouldn't charge me this time, but in the future, the boxes need to be taped up or there would be a charge. But clearly Jennifer is not familiar with customer service or kindness to her patrons. Last time going there. I don't give money to those who are unkind and don't appreciate their customers. It only takes one time, Jennifer.","stars":1}
{"text":"In a word...remarkable. This UPS Store location literally saved my Super Bowl event. \n\nI contacted the manager just before closing time. Not only was he willing to stay late to complete my hefty project, he arranged delivery/transportation back to my hotel (in his personal vehicle!). \n\nI have never received service quite like this from any service/store. I was so delighted, I contacted him a few days later with another rush request. It was handled expertly once again.\n\nI can't say enough about the friendliness, professionalism, and quality service I experienced. \n\nIf you need help with any printing/shipping project, do not hesitate to contact this establishment. You won't be disappointed.","stars":5}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience ever. The managers at this store were extremely rude and unhelpful. Don't go to this store, it's a franchise and if the store makes an error or there's a delivery issue neither UPS or this store will help you or accept responsibility. You will be stuck in a cycle of customer service hell.","stars":1}

I drop in often with my Amazon return items, that have the return shipping label already on the box, and the fabulous staff allow me to leave it there,  and  they take care of it when they are not busy. I avoid the long line, and they are not pressured with another person in line. Always, the same or next day I get a notification from Amazon that my return was accepted.","stars":5}

Alexis thank you very much for always making my visit as pleasant as possible. \n\nDear UPS, she is the finest employee.","stars":5}
{"text":"First class service! Phoned them up and they were super friendly. A couple days later, I dropped off a very large package I needed to return to a retailer (it was over 5 feet long). As I was backing up the car, an employee noticed and actually came out of the store into the parking lot to help me carry it in. He (Jeremy maybe?) was a really nice guy--indicated he'd take care of taping on the return slip and removing my old one from the box. Impressed and will return with any shipping/packing needs.","stars":5}
{"text":"We visited this store location on Saturday with a variety of disparate items, glassware, a huge 55\" TV, an electric scooter, instant pot, etc. My son was moving from Tulane U to Tufts in Boston and we were flying home to NY so needed to ship these times. Miss Karen (I think this was your name, sorry if I got it wrong?) helped us first and she was patient and lovely but the cost was really high. Mr Fred (the owner) got involved and said he would work with us and work with us he did. He designed creative ways to pack things within things and reduce the size and number of cartons. Needless to say the price was reduced by almost half. He is a lovely gentleman, patient and kind. Our entire experience at this location was stellar. I would encourage anyone who lives in this area to frequent this store!","stars":5}
{"text":"I came in the other day to send a UPS envelope. I asked the cashier to read through the list of prices dependent on time arrival. He read the first one then stopped and there was silence, to acknowledge him I said \"ok\" assuming he would keep going down the list. Instead, he pressed whatever button causes a transaction to process without going through the list. \nI told him to void the transaction. I was not about to pay $70 to send an envelope containing two pieces of paper from Philadelphia to Delaware when I could drive it there myself for a quarter of the cost. I asked him to read the rest of the pricing and he read only the second option. I said that 12:30 arrival time was fine for $32 and some change. He said he would not undo the transaction and \"too bad\" it already went through. I told him I did not agree to it! He raised his voice pointing at all the other people in line and said \"I have 10 more people to ring up and we close in 5 minutes, ma'am! Are you really going to make all those people wait for you?\" Of course everyone looked up and stared at me. They close at 6PM, the time stamp on my receipt is 5:23PM. Incredible. Basically, this is the same as saying the quality of my transaction is dependent on how many individuals are in line and what time it is. If this person actually knew how to tell time, maybe he would have calmed down but I guess that's not a prerequisite to working at the UPS Store. \n\nWhen I called to file a complaint about the transaction, I explained what happened and was met with an ill-mannered and confrontational manager who immediately began yelling and talking over me and yelling \"what's wrong with you?\" (yes, really) I asked her to stop yelling at me and talk to me in a professional manner and she said she was. She continued yelling and talking down to me and actually became more belligerent, I hung up! No way will I be yelled at!! No wonder this store is so hopelessly inefficient, dirty, and disorganized!! \n\nOh, did I mention I stood in line twice because the transaction sheets are in a pile by the register at the head of the line and no where else in the store to be found? \nI will never step foot in here again, these employees are SCARY!!!!","stars":1}

{"text":"This UPS Store is special because it functions as Belmont University's student shipping center. They do everything they can to serve students  including offering mailing label pouches and taping up return packages for free.\nThe print services are even more of a hidden gem in this store. Rob and his team are incredibly professional with their business printing services but they also can help out students. Rob helped me out with my recital posters and went above and beyond any of my expectations for how incredibly they turned out. He adjusted the color so they would come out brightly and he cut them so perfectly. His prints just look amazing compared to your average job.\nDefinitely recommended to check out if you're a Belmont student. Love you Rob!","stars":5}

{"text":"Since this location is closest to my work, I have no choice but to take care of my shipping needs here. I dread taking my packages to this location, because employees are lazy, rude, incompetent, and need to take a course in customer service 101. A month ago, I was there to ship a package. The store was almost empty; I walked up to the counter and waited about 5 minutes, and no one in the store acknowledge that I was there. One male employee was admiring his iPod, so he didn't even look at me. The other two employees were helping customers. 10 minutes later, I was still standing there without talking to anyone. It took almost 30 minutes for me to get out of there. Two days ago, I went to this store to ship another package. This time there were two employees behind the counter, so I asked for a ground shipping form to one of the employees. She said, \"we ran out of ground shipping labels\" and she suggested that I use the three day shipping service. What a service. I had to lug 20 pound package to 12th and Chestnut street location to get the package shipped. Who's is the owner of this location? Does the owner or the corporate office know what's going on at this location?","stars":1}
{"text":"Update: the tracking info finally updated on UPS as delivered, some 47 hours later after the original guaranteed delivery time. I really appreciate the local UPS, especially Antonio for continuing to work with me to track down the package. However, corporate UPS left a lot to be desired, not only did they lie about not receiving the package, they never offered a sincere apology in the matter. Instead, they were quick to point finger at the store for not handing over the package. In addition, because of their lies, it has resulted in great stress on my part because I don't know if I would have a ride for my wife this X'mas. Had they simply admitted fault in the first place that they missed the deadline and the package was still in Tucson, we won't have to go through this exercise.","stars":4}

{"text":"In a word, this place sucks. Rude and slow employees. One employee simply walked away in the middle of a transaction because she couldn't spell. They tried to charge me $18 for a cardboard box. They said its policy if they tape the box shut. Go to the post office, go to FedEx but DO NOT go here.","stars":1}
{"text":"Update- next day. Still no answer. Bee here for almost 30 minutes...tried to call manager...no voicemail.\n\nNever again. I'm new and thought this was the only nearby game in town (turns out it's not). Each time I was underwhelmed, if not utterly confused by the lack of service. I'm writing this as I sit on hold with the BIG UPS- a package I shipped (returning a fine WATCH!) appears to have been delivered to the wrong place. This UPS is a franchise, so they can't even give info on the package. Awful, awful, awful.  Unless you want to ship someone that you don't like and never want to hear from again, please save yourself the trouble.","stars":1}
{"text":"The staff in this store are awesome. I had a lot of different items to pack , and they were very patient, thorough, polite, and professional.

I am no fan of having my time wasted. Booo!","stars":1}
{"text":"The staff here has always been helpful.  The wait can be a little long at certain times of the day if you're in a hurry (I'm probably just impatient).  They've got every supply you could possibly need to ship just about anything.  Even if I've brought my own box, I invariably forget something like packing materials or tape or whatever.  They've always got me covered and the rates are reasonable.  The cutoff time for dropoffs is also relatively late.","stars":4}

Waste of our time; this isn't the first time we've had issues at this UPS so we will be taking our business elsewhere going forward.\n\n\nUPDATE 10/7/2019 after owner response:\n\nThank you for your response and apology, however we were not made aware of your printer issues until we came to pick it up. I understand things are automatically placed on the website regardless of your problems, but why weren't we contacted so we could plan accordingly? Had we been called/notified in advance by Mgmt I wouldn't even be mad or have reviewed your business appropriately. We had to drive all the way to your business before we first found this out, waited 15 mins for you all to try to print it on another device and then eventually had no choice but to cancel the order bc the quality from your other printer was so poor. By the time we realized you could not fulfill the order as promised though, it was too late in the day to try and order elsewhere so you also gave us no choice but to handle things next day.","stars":1}

{"text":"This in no way has anything to do with how I feel about UPS as a company. I am a huge fan of UPS' shipping services. I give UPS Shipping Quality 5 Stars......\n\nThis review is for the UPS store at 17th and Market. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is the most unprofessional location of the UPS store that I have ever been to in my life. The staff is completely unprofessional, the store is an absolute mess, and this gives UPS a bad name.\n\nA few weeks ago, I needed to mail something that I needed insured. I went online to UPS and printed out my own shipping label and needed the UPS store to sign off on the receipt of the shipment. The staff member did not even know what the form was for before he signed it.  I had to explain to him on what he needed to do.... How am I an expert on UPS services? I'm confused.....\n\nOh, and did I mention they close at 6pm!? I understand the economy is in trouble, but really? Is this necessary to close so early? If I am going to do UPS myChoice and have my packages redirected to this location what's the point if you close at 6pm? Obviously if I couldn't be home when they are trying to drop off the package, I need you to be open later so I can come and pick up my package. Hmm.... odd.\n\nIn searching for the UPS store on Yelp I saw that the 13th and Chestnut location has very positive reviews, so long UPS Store Market Street.... \n\nI have sent a note to UPS asking for them to call me so that I can talk to them about their location here.....

When I saw again that the package said delivered to the UPS store I decided to drive there. I asked for the package and without even looking but at a list he said no package here. I ask him to look some more because the website said it was there and I knew that was wrong answer because he told me over the phone they don't look up tracking or the website. His answer was call UPS. Then he \"locates\" the package with an attitude and asked me for my id which I had to go back to the car for. He again had an attitude \"you need that\" then I realized it was in my laptop bag so I came back into the store and said is there anything else I can provide I had my gun premit other id, checkbook etc and he said no I need your ID with Michael Lloyd. Which just upset me this is our horses meds which UPS hasn't delivered in a 4 days do to errors. I told him he was being an asshole. Let's just say he and his blonde coworker where laughing and when I mentioned that wasnt right as a customer service representative laughing at a customer wasnt the right thing to do his reply I am an asshole. Then he cussed and asked me to leave without attempting to help me figure out how to get my horses meds that he could die without.

This is a franchise and not a corporate store, that doesn't mean they need to be angering customers as it reflects badly on the company as a whole. I'd say i'd never shop with UPS again if I didn't know that most UPS stores are very nice. I get that perhaps foreigners do not understand the level of service an American expects, that said...learn or lose customers.

Can't get an updated license and not moved into a permanent home yet.

However, I need to get mail and start getting settled in the city.\n\nGoogling around I found out the UPS had mailbox's. I had to call around to find a place in the city with available boxes and enter 7715 Crittenden. From the phone conversation on Friday to the interaction in store on Saturday they were phenomenal. Friendly, courteous, and professional. We had a technical issue with the computer when I was there, and there are only two people allowed in store (by-product of the pandemic) so I got to see them interact with several people. I am leaving this review because the level of customer service was just incredible. Must-tasking to help everyone, smiling, helpful and I'm a big believer in giving feedback both ways.

Usually I would use the one on Elysian Fields (those girls are sweethearts!) but their printer was broken and since I have no printer of my own I came to this location.\n\nFirst the lady at the desk told me it would cost $5 just to print the label which is crazy. I chose the \"free return\" option at Amazon for a reason and I had just paid $2 in parking just to be there. Plus, as much as I would hate to make multiple trips, this would cost me maybe cents, if anything, at FedEx. But I acquiesced and sent her my return label just like I had done at other UPS stores. She then insisted that she would not open it and refused to ship my return. I called Amazon and they had no answers as to why they would act like this and sent me a new label via snail mail so I could just use the Elysian Fields location. \n\nAs I've seen in replies to other reviews, each UPS store is independently owned and to quote the lady at the store \"every UPS store is different.\" This one is worth going out of your way to avoid. I'd rather drive 30 minutes out of town (or, in this situation, wait a few days) just to use another location who actually gives a shirt about service. UPS should consider cutting this location altogether as it is tarnishing its name.","stars":1}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be the type of person to leave a Yelp review for a UPS store, but here we are.  This morning I went to this location before work to return a WEDDING DRESS, ie a super expensive item, which I did via UPS because I wanted the peace of mind to be able to track it and know when I could expect a refund.  Well, joke is on me, because after I left I realized nothing actually printed on the receipt, and when I went back to ask if there was any way to re-print the receipt or salvage the tracking number, they were super rude about it and told me there is no way to re-provide that info.  Now to be clear, I don't expect sales associates to make up a new technology on the spot that reprints shipping receipts, but I do expect them to be polite and apologetic, especially in the wake of THEIR mistake.  I don't feel as though the onus should be on me to double-check that their printer is working and printing out receipts correctly - up until today that was an issue that never even crossed my mind.  The sales associate should have noticed that barely anything printed on the receipt before handing it to me, and after the fact, should have apologized for the massive inconvenience.  But instead, I didn't receive so much as a 'sorry' and now I just have to wait and *hope* that this dress makes it back to the company I ordered it from so that I can get refunded thousands of dollars.  So basically, if you can avoid going here, I would, and I certainly wouldn't consider shipping anything valuable or expensive from this location.

Gave them my information and the tracking number and was told it is still not there. Was told to call UPS customer service. Why am I physically IN a UPS store calling UPS? Shouldn't that be the job of the employee? So I waste 10 minutes on customer service with UPS and they tell me it was delivered and signed for by *name omitted*. They can do an investigation but can take 1-8 business days. Again- why can't they just SPEAK to one another on the phone while I'm standing there is besides me. I walk back in and say \"does **** work here\" I get a yes response. I say well he signed for it on 7/11. They tell me no, that's incorrect. Then they look again and sure enough the package is there after again I say the corporate office is saying this individual signed for the package. The package was under \"SAA\" so they didn't realize it (even though my name is clearly on the box). Great.

Low and behold, a call to UPS revealed that the missing package had NEVER been received. The package NEVER left MBE until I called them and PROVED, through UPS, that it had never been sent.\n\nSecond issue... I mailed out 38 invites. Each was a square envelope and I needed them hand stamped so that the invites inside weren't damaged or wrinkled. The postage required was $0.69. I was charged $1.18 EACH. I wasn't told the postage was $0.69, only that it would be $1.18 for each. I assumed with the shape (square envelopes are always extra) that was a decent charge. After paying, I asked to see one of the envelopes so I had an idea of what they would look like with the hand stamped postage mark. When it was handed to me to look at I saw the $0.69 postage mark. I asked why the charge was so expensive and why it wasn't disclosed - and the clerks EXACT WORDS we're \"If I wasted my time explaining charges to everyone all day i'd never get anything done.\" \n\nSo instead they charged double the postage and treated me to free attitude. \n\nI will never use MBE again.

{"text":"The price plus the service makes you want to avoid this place as much as possible. First of all, I have been this place quite a lot because I sell collector items on mline and have quite a lot Amazon returns which make this location very convenient for me; and to be fair, most of the hired employee here are fairly nice, including the older guy who is the owner. But recently the wife of the owner are there quite often, and almost every time I am there she has that unfriendly look. To be in a service industry, she really doesn't understand how to deliver a sinole service.  \n\nToday was the final draw. I came in with a prepaid package by Dell, but for some reason the email only contained the receipt (with tracking number), I figure the email was given by UPS, the drop off store should be able to take care of it, so I went in anyway.\n\n Long story short, at the store they said they cant ship it without the label and they cant produce the label even though I have the official email from UPS with already made tracking number.  Honestly, this is fine, but it's that old lady's attitude that really annoyed me. The initial guy who basically said the same thing to me was in a completely different manner, but he said she is the boss so he wanted to confirm with her. She basically made it sound it's not their problem even though it is an UPS store, only their parent company. I almost wanted laugh at that statement, because UPS is their parent company, it's even more reason for them to provide service for them, a good service.  \n\nShe end up trying to get me out of there by giving me an UPS number. So I decided just to call them right there. After speaking to UPs on the phone, they were able to point me the direction to get the actual label, and said the store should be able to help me print thr label there.  So i asked another lady who worked there to help me out. Just right before she was going to help me, the old hack stopped her said it would cost $5!! Really?! Its going to cost me $5 for printing an UPS own label so UPS can ship out this box which is already paid for!?? Again, it's not even so much about the money, it's the principle and her attitude pushed me to write this long negative review.

{"text":"I live across the street in the Chestnut Hill Village.  I came here a couple of years ago and was so impressed by the professionalism of the representative on staff.  He went beyond the call of duty.  I was so impressed by him, and the services that he offered me, I stopped going anywhere else.  I believe he was the store manager.\n\nToday, I went into this UPS location to return an unwanted package back to Amazon. I grabbed an envelope, placed it on the counter, and proceeded to search for 75 cents in my bag.  Jennifer approaches me, snatches the envelope that was on the counter in an aggressive manner, snatches my Amazon receipt that was under my bag, and barks that I must place the receipt in the bag in the most, aggressive, exaggerated hostile fashion imaginable.  Mind you, I was planning on doing all of this after I purchased the envelope. \n\nJennifer then proceeds to seal my envelope.  All of this happened so quickly.  She had no idea if I had placed all of my contents in the envelope.  I neither wanted her to do this, nor was I was expecting it.  When I said something to her, she said, again in an extremely aggressive and hostile manner, \"most customers are trying to get in and out, and would appreciate my helping them.\".   At this point, her arms are flailing about and she is yelling at me, ironically, as she is repeatedly apologizing to me in the most insincere and aggressive fashion.  \"I am sorry, what more do you want me to do.\"  Everything about her was just gross and over the top.  \n\nI must admit, it was feeling a little like the Starbucks coffee situation.  I am an African American woman, and I was dressed in beat up sweat pants.  I have never had any customer service representative respond  to me with such hostility and aggression.  Mind you, I was was literally off to the side, just searching for money to pay for an envelope.  I had pre-printed a UPS return label to Amazon that I brought with me.  That is what she was grabbing along with my merchandise.  I legitimately thought she was on something, or was racist, or maybe a combination of the two?  She was degrading, and condescending, and there was no apparent reason for her hostility.\n\nBecause I really liked this store, I was thinking that this was an anomaly.  I called the corporate office to report this store because they are using UPS's brand name, and felt they should be aware of what is happening at a location bearing their logo, because after all, it reflects on their brand.\n\nI thought about it, and also wanted to lodge a formal complaint at the store with the manager.  Apparently, the tall guy with the long hair is THE OWNER.  I proceeded to share my story with him, unaware that he was romantically connected to the person I was complaining about at this point.  \n\nAs I was sharing my experience with him, he interrupts me to tell me to calm down in a patronizing manner; a very typical male gas-lighting silencing tactic.  He clearly did not care about what I was saying or what had transpired, and had no real customer service skills himself.  He then proceeds to inform me that the person I was complaining about was HIS WIFE, and the co-owner of the store.  The conversation was over for me at that point.  I knew that that rudeness and unprofessionalism had come directly from the top down, and no amount of conversation or dialogue could fix that. What happened today was indicative of how they do business as the owners of this store.\n\nI WILL NEVER give them another dime of my money, and regret being such a loyal customer for the last two plus years.  They did not deserve any of my business.  As a conscientious shopper, I believe in only supporting businesses who treat me and others with respect and dignity.  That is non-negotiable.  It is a prerequisite to my doing business with any company.  There are too many competitors in any field to ever have to be subjected to abuse of any kind in an establishment where you are paying someone to provide a service to you or for you.  Good customer service is the bare minimum for my business.\n\nI retrieved my package from this store.  The package contained a $300 pair of eyeglasses, and after Jennifer's erratic behavior, I did not trust leaving my merchandise with that establishment.  I had no faith in her professionalism, and thought she might actually do something to sabotage my package, or the delivery of my package in retaliation.  I re-printed up a new label and dropped it off at the post office in the same shopping center just a few doors down without incident.  There was no drama or hoopla.\n\nMy recommendation is to avoid this store because Jennifer is the co-owner, and she was pretty vile.  Her husband was not particularly responsive, as to be expected, after all she is his wife, and he was clearly standing by her.  \n\nI am officially done with these UPS franchise stores that bear the UPS logo, but are not governed by the same corporate policies, values or procedures as UPS the corporation.","stars":1}

When it was never received I went back to the store and was told they never scanned it in but that they would pass on my information to a manager and that I would be contacted to sort out the issue.

She was helping a customer with paperwork, which would have been fine but she did not acknowledge that there was a long line of other customers waiting.  She didn't even look up.  One customer said he had been waiting 20 minutes!  It would have helped if the staff person had at minimum said good morning and apologized for the delay.  Several of us asked her what was going on and she finally said that another staff person had gone out.  Still didn't look up at us or apologize. Finally after about 30 minutes the other staff person came back. She helped customers but didn't acknowledge the line or apologize for the wait either or even smile!

{"text":"Please avoid this UPS Store at all cost. I used them about a year ago insuring an item to be sent home. They provided paper work showing their guarantee, policies and procedures. \n\nRecently I used them to ship a Mac Pro desktop computer to an ebay buyer insuring the item for the amount purchased. They were to pack and ship. The owner of the store filled out everything in the computer, yet provided me with nothing and told me everything would be fine. I asked for paperwork and a receipt and he said there was none...and gave me his business card and said he was the owner, call him if there were any problems. I felt weird dropping off an expensive mac computer with nothing showing I had ever been there except his word. \n\nHe did call me later to get my credit card number after he packed the item, which I gave him. I got a very vague notice via email from iShip telling me the tracking number and that it was to be shipped from that UPS Store location, nothing else to show what the item was or the amount.\n\nThe receipt received the mac the following week and it was completely damaged. He sent me pictures of the box. All the ends were town open. You could tell UPS had tossed it around. The case was bent, the hard drives and graphics cards were broken. I could tell from the shape of the box that there was no additional packing material, or very little, used as the box formed to the shape of the mac. It was awful and sad...and I had to deal with an angry ebay buyer.\n\nBE WARNED, if you use this location, and they provide you with no paperwork for your shipment, walk away...no RUN.

He went to one UPS Store location in Brentwood, but they closed about 15 minutes before he got there, so he frantically drove to this location in hopes of making it. I called while he was en route, confirming they were open until 7, but the woman on the phone was super rude and emphasized that they closed at \"7 SHARP.\" I just called to confirm the hours; I didn't ask her to stay open later or anything. He made it to the door at 7 --- maaaybe 7:01 -- and saw the woman closing up, and she was mouthing something but he couldn't understand her. So instead of opening the door and maybe helping him, she just pointed to the sign and left it at that. \n\nI get it, you have certain hours that you're open until, and his package probably wouldn't have even gone out until the morning anyway, but I think that was a rude way of handling it -- both on the phone and in person. \n\nI'm all about supporting small businesses, but I won't be going to this location ever again. The employees at the Brentwood location are helpful and kind, unlike here. Go there instead.","stars":1}

I cannot say enough about how awesome this UPS store was for me!","stars":5}
{"text":"A disgrace to the company! \n\nI came in to return a package from Amazon. Usually I would use the one on Elysian Fields (those girls are sweethearts!) but their printer was broken and since I have no printer of my own I came to this location.\n\nFirst the lady at the desk told me it would cost $5 just to print the label which is crazy. I chose the \"free return\" option at Amazon for a reason and I had just paid $2 in parking just to be there. Plus, as much as I would hate to make multiple trips, this would cost me maybe cents, if anything, at FedEx. But I acquiesced and sent her my return label just like I had done at other UPS stores. She then insisted that she would not open it and refused to ship my return. I called Amazon and they had no answers as to why they would act like this and sent me a new label via snail mail so I could just use the Elysian Fields location. \n\nAs I've seen in replies to other reviews, each UPS store is independently owned and to quote the lady at the store \"every UPS store is different.\" This one is worth going out of your way to avoid. I'd rather drive 30 minutes out of town (or, in this situation, wait a few days) just to use another location who actually gives a shirt about service. UPS should consider cutting this location altogether as it is tarnishing its name. \n\nReply to Customer Service:\n\nActually I did communicate with you before posting this review. When I was in the store.   There was zero interest in resolving this issue, thus I posted a review (something that does not require your permission) The lady who worked there was appalling. It was definitely one of the most horrifying customer service experiences I've ever had.\n\nThe $5 fee is actually not standard. Amazon and every other UPS location I've been too was shocked in regards to the $5 fee. Amazon (a partner of UPS) even offered to refund me for the $5 because they were so embarrassed for you and your location's actions but I have zero interest in giving you any money whatsoever. \n\nUnfortunately the UPS on Elysian Fields is closed (this is likely because they were not situated in a busy or prosperous area rather than their level of service) but there is one in the convention center and THEY are also awesome. No $5 fee (I'm pretty sure it all cost me less than a dollar), they tape everything up for  me for free (another thing that you apparently exorbitantly charge for) sent it out the next day and were a joy to work with. They are about 10 extra minutes out of my way but I don't mind. They are now my \"go to\" UPS location. Anything to avoid YOUR location. Truly UPS should either shutter your location or change management as it is embarrassing an otherwise awesome company. \n\nUPS: You are awesome. Don't let this location sully your reputation.","stars":1}

On my first visit, the young clerk had to deal with a 'no-masker' before me and he did so politely but assertively - good for him. I commented that he probably had to deal with that a lot and I was sorry about it. I was there to send an item back to a manufacturer so I intended on buying a box. He offered to find me a used box so I could save money then offered to package it up for me. So kind and helpful. Today, it was just a simple drop off - same clerk. Again, attentive and helpful.

The other gal with brown hair, well, you better not speak to her, can't read her, she seems nice, then not... but efficient. The owner Tom is a dead brick of a guy.

However, life happens and my schedule changed up and I needed to get his gifts to him pronto. \n\nHis three gifts were all wrapped in gift paper and the greeting card celebrating his 29th birthday was ready to go. When I arrived at the store, I was immediately greeted by a cheerful staff member. He listened to my needs and asked if any of the items were fragile. When I told him yes, he explained the necessity of using a larger box to accommodate the bubble to protect my fabulous gift. \n\nAfter completing the paperwork, he gave me a tracking number and informed me that my gifts would arrive the next day. I texted the tracking number to my cuz so he'd know he had a surprise waiting for him when he got off work. \n\nUPS rescued me, delivered my gifts quickly and safe. The price was more then a tank of gas, but it was well worth it. My time is valuable and this saved me big time. \n\nI'll be back? - If the need arises, I use them again and again. \n\nWhen: January 29, 2018\nWhy: Shipping priceless birthday gifts.","stars":4}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. This location lacks the training and customer service to handle situations. I had a horrific situation here with the cashier Mary. She needs training in professionalism/customer service and UPS protocol handling Amazon returns.\nIncompetence of company policy and procedure is no excuse. Get trained, if you don't know something pick up a phone and call corporate and find out. \nYou either like your job or you don't. Those who take pride in their work would have picked up the phone and called corporate if they were not familiar with a procedure. \"The UPS Store 5220\" exemplifies the lazy, disgruntled, incompetent employee. \nUnfortunately, she is representing a great company and I know 99% of the other UPS stores are class. I would not recommend this location. If they aren't making a profit off your package, they will put you on the back burner, waste your time and play dumb. Stay away!\nAmazon and UPS have a billion dollar shipping agreement. EVERYONE USES AMAZON THESE DAYS, understand the current policies and procedures or lose your franchise.

{"text":"I am very disappointed to have to write this review. However, based on a recent experience at this local UPS store, I feel obligated. Long story short, I brought in a package with a pre-printed label. Ryan, who was working that day, wasn't able to scan the label. Instead of entering in the tracking number or looking up the receiver's account, he turned me away. I wasted my time and gas to discover that this store could have easily reprinted a label. I actually chatted with the store supervisor to be told that reprinting a label was \"something new to her.\"\n\nSo... I have now escalated this to the corporate office. The store manager alluded that because they are franchised, they are limited with what they can do. However, to have a franchise - with any company - you are expected to follow rules and guidelines, especially when it comes to providing solid customer service. I'm surprised with the level of apathy demonstrated and will be hard-pressed to use or recommend UPS, especially this store.","stars":1}

This despite the signs posted on the center clearly offering notary services. To be fair, the manager of the site did respond and offer an apology after I complained, which was very nice. All is forgiven, I thought. \n\nToday I tried to sign up for a private mailbox. I stopped by yesterday to get the info, then came back today with the required info. I arrived 30 minutes before closing, and the employee dismissed me, saying that service \"was closed for the day.\" You mean filling out a form is closed for the day? Not sure I understand; you're here, I'm here...what's the problem? She suggested I come back tomorrow, and I decided three visits was just too much effort to get UPS to take my money. So I won't be going back there ever. They might be OK at taking packages to ship, but honesty you're probably better off just going to the FedEx at 20th and Market.

The system is really convenient; when I receive a package, I get a text and an email letting me know - then I just stop by during their open hours to pick the package up. What has really made me grateful for this UPS location is the customer service though! The employees at this location are great! They're really nice, friendly, helpful (insert other good adjectives here), and they really make an effort to get to know their customers (not that they have much of a choice with me - I've been coming in ALL the time for packages since we've been moving and figuring out we're missing things).

So I called the store to find out what is going on. The clerk who helped me yesterday was the same person that answered. He swears that all the packages were picked up by the UPS driver yesterday and there was no missed packages. I called our jeweler and of course they did not receive it. When I called UPS, they refused to help me and asked me to call the UPS Store and have them call UPS to confirm that the package was indeed picked up. This is supposed to be a rush order to replace my wife's lost engagement ring. Now, we have another situation to deal with.

You can always hear them arguing with the manager or hear the manager imploring them to work.  They'll all catch an attitude with you over the simplest things - it's just ridiculous.  Not to mention the wait times - it's not uncommon to wait 20+ minutes while one person works the counter and 4-5 people just stand around doing nothing.  Something's gotta give.","stars":2}
{"text":"My experience was excellent thanks to Miss Tori!\n\nAll staff were helping customers. I waited on my designated spot. There was a couple at the counter so I waited patiently. Another customer entered the building and Tori greeted him. I wasn't sure if she saw me behind the couple so I stepped around them and said I'm next and she gestured she saw my. \n\nWhen she helped email label to return an Amazon product and pointed to a printer and informed me my label would print there. While I was waiting she helped the man she greeted before assisting me. She scanned his phone and gave her a product. Once she was done my label had printer and she helped me. \n\nTori was polite and courteous. She even explained she greet her customers when they enter and ask what service they needed and that she was going to assist me after her initial inquiry. She didn't have to explain her procedures to assist customers and if made me feel seen and heard. That I sincerely appreciated and with efficacy she took care of the customers all while be patient. \n\nThis was my first visit to this location and whenever I have needs that can be assisted via UPS I'll definitely return. The store was clean and a bit smaller so prepare for social distancing options. \n\nJust a side note. Greetings are kind and professional. Just like Tori greets customers so should the other staff. Calling someone name out without a hello or I'll be right with you seems a bit obtuse. Customer service agents must understand they are agents of service to customer. Thanks Tori hopefully they'll emulate your customer service skill set.","stars":5}

I've tried a few competitors which have frustrated me with not being able to email them documents and have them printed, so for me, this place is a win!  I also found the services to be rather affordable, it was around $20 for a few printouts, a few out of state faxes and 2 small packages to be mailed, I think that's a very good deal.  I found the sales associates to be friendly, helpful and efficient, they were playing some upbeat music too!  The store is tidy, well organized and well lit, easy to find things.  My only comment would be that it was a little hard for me to find this store initially because they're in the Mellon Building, I think the signage could be a little bit clearer, more obvious.

I'd slaved away at home in advance trying to fill out the paperwork, get photographs taken, and making sure I'd completed the necessary requirements. Once I got to the UPS Store, I was happy to find that in addition to having their own parking lot (free parking y'all!), they also have a passport center! Their passport center comes complete with people to help you fill out the passport applications correctly, and to get your application mailed! We put our names in the cue while I stood in line to get a money order for the passport fees. I was surprised and happy to find out that using the passport center to look over our applications had no charge whatsoever! The thing with government processes is that they can take a ton of time, especially if you fill out the paperwork incorrectly. Going to the UPS store that day was a fateful benefit to us, as our new passports were mailed to us in less than 6 weeks! Now, I can travel the world without issue! I'm definitely a fan of the UPS Store, and their one stop shop passport services!","stars":4}

Did they assure me they knew what they were doing?  Of course.  I paid $98.08 to ship several items back to my home in California. That is alot of money folks. \n\nOne of the items I shipped is a very fragile and valuable Boxer statue. It is a limited edition which has not been made in years. I questioned the gal over shipping it back to my home or just bringing it on the plane with me. They repeatedly assured me they do this for a living and my statue, and all other items, would be carefully packed. \n\nThe box arrived several days later. Just a plain brown box and crushed on top. Looks like either someone sat on the box or put a very heavy object on it. But it is crushed. I opened the box and was happy to find lots of bubble wrap but no peanuts. I removed 7 lbs of various books, show catalogs and a framed picture. With hardly any cushion sat below my prized dog statue. BROKEN!!!  The weight of the 7 lbs of books coupled with the crushed box top had broken the ears off my boxer dogs! \n\nI was devastated. Who puts 7 lbs of books on top of a fragile statue??   I told them over and over again it was valuable and fragile. \n\n7 lbs of books........almost $100 paid to ship \"safely\".......the most important thing in the box is broken. \n\nOh, and all the super light items were on the bottom. Of course. \n\nI have sent an email to the store and am trying to get an email to their corp office. I bought insurance but seriously.........you can't replace this hand crafted item.

And refused to change it!  I'll go to the REAL UPS depot next time.  I've  never had problems there.

{"text":"I've gone to this store regularly for over 5 years and for a variety of needs. I've alway liked the staff very much. However today was my last day. I went to get a document notarized for my long-stay visa to Europe, where I have family, and it needs to be sent quickly; I've done this three times in the past 5 years for the same document at this UPS store. The staff has also notarized all sorts of European documents for various visas in the past. Today they would not notarize it because it's in three languages (Italian, German, French and a little bit of English) because they can't read the document, even though it's only got peoples names on it and between those three languages, 90% of it is completely phonetically the same as English. It's not a rocket science document to review. It's just a marriage/partnership certificate, not an important document that has signatures on it or anything. Instead of problem-solving the issues, they handled the situation terribly. The policy, which they showed me, didn't state that the document had to be in English, just the they had to be able to communicate in English with the signer to be able to \"discern\" the document. I guess my PhD is not good enough to help them \"discern\" the phonetics. This new policy is coming from a bad current political system that is anti-immigration, we all know that; and they are upholding it. I'll never spend my money at this store ever again, they revealed themselves. I left the store very angry, which makes me sad, since I trusted this business.

{"text":"Somewhat helpful I guess. I've had bad experiences as a recipient from FedEx so when I order car parts they ship via UPS so I receive them with no complaints. So I decided if UPS always come through for me, I might as well use them to ship things. However when I got there, The girl Samantha looked bored when I walked in and for some reason looked like she didn't want to help me. She'd kind of avoid looking at me and when asked for insurance I was a bit thrown off. I don't ship stuff consistently so I'm kind of lost when it comes to insurance, shipping, and the amount you put down covers. Didn't really explain it too well either or recommend how it works. She only mentioned that I'll be fine with basic insurance if it's only $100 and under BUT ONLY because I asked I wanted to put $5 and if there was a recommendation or rule of thumb to go by. Again I repeat I rarely ship things so I'm a little confused sometimes. Last time I'll ever come here.","stars":1}

And absolutely worth it. \nWe have done Amazon returns printed made copies and shifting and every time I experience has been great.  Yes they are almost always busy especially a couple minutes before closing time, but that never has caused them to act anything less than professional or even seemingly stressed. For example yesterday I showed up 15 minutes before they closed they ended up closing close to 10 minutes after the second time because they had so many people coming in at the last minute needing help. I never got any kind of inkling from them that they were annoyed frustrated etc.  The gentleman Who works there is much quieter than the two women so as a talker myself I prefer working with the two women. Barbara in particular is always extremely kind professional and helpful. They look at options to help you get a good deal and the processes always seem clean and efficient \n\nThe parking can be tough during lunch time and close to closing as they share the lot with several other businesses.

He returns, and just looks at me...............It was awkward, needless to say.  I then politely say, \"Can I have a receipt?\" He then asks in an annoyed tone \"You want a receipt?!\" Before I can respond, he hits a button and prints out a proof of return receipt.  To which, all I could think was, he was not going to give me a proof of return, and was going to let me walk out the store.  Then there would be no way for me to prove I returned my item. And if that item got lost or STOLEN in transit back to Amazon, Id have no proof that I turned it over to UPS.  So BEWARE, get your proof of return receipt, because they wont offer it to you!

{"text":"I want to start by saying I have tried every other avenue before writing this review.  Last month I shipped seven glass bowls from this location. I Did the \"pack and ship guarantee\", and Four of them arrived shattered because of poor packaging. Luckily, I had bought the insurance and called the store to start a claim. The employee that I spoke to told me that I needed to ship back the broken glass to be investigated for the claim. I came out of pocket $69.20 to ship the broken glass which was promised to be refunded to me as part of the claim.  The manager Blake has been extremely helpful, and was able to get me the money back for the claim, except for the $69.20 to ship the broken glass. The owner is refusing to refund that money, because he is positive that his employee would have never told me to ship back the broken glass because that is not their policy. After spending Countless hours on the phone with UPS, the owner is still refusing to refund the money, because I guess He thinks this customer is trying to get one over on him. I'm not sure why he would think I would pay to ship broken glass on my own dime if somebody didn't tell me that. I guess the new trend in customer service is \"the customer is always wrong\". The owner told UPS corporate that it's not about the money- he eats dinners for more than $70, it's the fact that he is positive his employee didn't say that. I am glad to see a company standing by their employee, but will absolutely never use the UPS store again and wouldn't recommend them to anyone else.","stars":1}

I was shipping vinyl records. Box arrived essentially destroyed with nothing in it. Yes, they delivered an empty box. It took multiple calls and emails to even get someone who would respond to me. Finally, Pam Fuld replied and began to move my claim along only to have Ben Brainis, the owner, come in and say that they would not cover this shipment, and to make it worse, insults me by saying that lots of other people shipped out vinyl records that day, and mine was the only that was lost, as if for some reason this would make me feel better......here's the quote from Ben, \"He remembered you well as you brought the package in your own carton, and he did tape it for you.  Furthermore, we had many other shipments with vinyl records that day that were shipped from here that were not damaged.  The damaged likely occurred from poor packaging and was damaged in transit while in the possession of the carrier.\" Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that from this, they are saying they packed it and it was damaged from poor packing.....Pretty sure they just admitted it was their fault. After going back an forth more with Pam, because Ben the OWNER stopped replying, very professional, I was told I couldn't speak to a district manager because it was privately owned, then started to get a lecture about tape...TAPE!

As if mailing a piece of plastic or nylon could ever hurt anyone. I wonder if his shop was getting robbed, would he tell the responding officer to leave his gun, holster, and \"anything related\" to a firearm in the car before responding to save his employees and business.\nThe only tool we have against these ignorant and biased business owners is to take our business and hard earned money elsewhere, and this is what I emplore you to do.

I thought this was going to be a super simple transaction. I was coming to make 100 colored copies. I've always worked in an office, so I never needed to pay for copies before. I figured I'd ask about the price and if it sounded reasonable I'd go ahead and make copies.\n\nThe employee working did not seem particularly happy to be there. I feel like a mother when I say she should adjust her tone, but she reminded me of a snappy teenager. I actually felt a little insulted when she asked me what did I want, but it was more her tone and mannerism than anything she said. I asked her how much copies were and she replied 10 cents. I figured I'd be paying about $10, which was fine in my books, so I asked her if the copier was set to color. She walked over, changed the settings and told me I could start my printing.\n\nFast forward to paying, turns out colored copies are 39 cents and black and white copies are 10 cents. So, when the bill came out to $41.73, I was really shocked. Instead of apologizing for quoting me the wrong price, the employee went on the defensive. She kept reiterating that she didn't know I was printing in color, even though she was the one who set the printer to color for me. \n\nI think what ruined this experience for me was two things. Obviously, the misquote, but if the employee had a friendlier attitude, I would have accepted that people make mistakes. Instead, I felt insulted and misguided. Not the best thing to associate with a business.\n\nAgain, the price difference wasn't huge, but the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. They do get one star for being clean!","stars":2}

Next time I will use the post office because it would cost less than $2 if I had. The worst part is that one of the cards didn't even make it to the destination. We tried to come in and ask what happened to the card we with the overpriced postage and the staff was so unhelpful. They said to talk to USPS to see what happened that there is nothing they can do especially since they didn't give me a receipt for my purchase. I'm very annoyed that I took the time to send my niece a birthday card with money and paid all that money for postage and it just disappeared and the UPS store tells me it's my problem to deal with the post office and not their fault.","stars":1}

Location staffed with unpleasant privileged Belmont students clueless in customer service.  We had a high value delivery to our home, which delivery agent decided should not be left at our home (even though no signature required).  Delivery slip stated to arrive at this store yesterday at 4pm.  Trip 1 after 4pm yesterday - sorry, not here yet.  Trip 2 at 9:30 this morning -  tall, curly headed Caucasian (and very rude) kid moved his mouse around and said sorry, not here yet.  No interest in checking to see if it had arrived and when I asked if I would have to wait in line 20 deep when I can back stood there with an empty stare and responded yes.  Upon returning home and checking UPS tracking discovered package had arrived 6:30 prior evening.  Called store and spoke with another clueless associate, explained my situation, put on hold for 3 minutes, he responded with \"it just arrived\".  Retuned to store to retrieve my package, expressed my frustration and was insulted with a sarcastic \"Merry Christmas\" from clueless Curly as I left for the third time.  Three trips for a package that was to be delivered to my home.  Would be nice if these kids understood the challenges their customers are enduring during tough times.\n\nThis store is very poorly managed.

She asked him, \"did you notice she was ahead in the line?\" and he simply said \"nope\". She asked him, \"do I deserve an apology\", he just ignored her. When I called him just now and asked him the same thing, he hung up on me.\n\nUpdate: My wife called UPS to complain. Since then, the owner called back and apologized to her saying it wasn't a racist act, just that he had a stressful day. He had two prior opportunities to do so instead of obfuscating. But at least in the end, he did the right thing.","stars":1}

Then the worker stated that she was uncomfortable and would not notarize the documents. She is a terrible and unprofessional UPS worker.

The car is in the driveway and we were most definitely home. So either the driver is lazy or they just don't care and didn't truly seek to try and deliver my package. When i tried to contact the store that is supposed to receive my package they wouldn't answer their phone. I called 4 times and finally spoke with a older spokesperson there who told me she could not track the package or contact the driver and told me i had to wait until the next day to pick it up. I understand thats their system of doing things but she was very rude and very unconcerned with my situation and i would highly not recommend dealing with Barbara at the UPS store on Baring and i would not use UPS for deliveries in the future due to their lack of care and effort in providing customers with their packages and the poor customer service their retail staff provide over the phone as well as the outdated and malfunctioning online capabilities of their websites.","stars":1}

These range from having a notary demand to review a private document with privileged and confidential information when the scope of notary services was strictly for verification of identity and signature; condescending and snarky comments to customers trying to get questions answered about shipping, when clear and helpful information was called for; refusal to accept Amazon returns that weren't in long- ago tossed original shipping boxes (because apparently you're supposed to know to keep the original container before you discover you got the wrong item). \n\nMost of these experiences, both my own and those I witnessed, were because one individual there has a lousy, \"I'm smarter than you\" attitude. And whose first answer has always been, \"no, we can't do that.\"  Pretty lazy and unhelpful. \n\nAfter the latest in a string of crappy experiences at this store I went to the store at La Cañada and had a much different experience. With people of good humor, who were interested in helping their customers, and who explained how their processes work, why they need to do what they do, etc. \n\nI will never use the Thornydale/Tangerine UPS store again and will be relaying this story to anyone I know who plans to use UPS.","stars":1}

Like many other UPS stores, it likely just depends on the time of day. Either way, I am always able to get my shipping needs taken care of at this spot. All in all, I wouldn't expect your experience here to be anything amazing, but it gets the job done.\n\nOne tip - perhaps this just during COVID because the gate is closed, but this location can be very difficult to find!  While the address is 1735 market, your best bet is to enter in from the entrance on JFK. I have spent a lot of time lugging around heavy packages just to have to make this runaround.","stars":3}

So if there are three customers there are three employees assisting. \nI also like the fact that if you need something packed you can just leave and not wait for them to do it. \nWhat I don't like and they have no control over is since it is an independently owned store you can't use your UPS account there.\nI also think shipping a laptop and power cord ground from Florida to New Hampshire with no extra insurance for $37 is extremely excessive and would use the USPS if it was not a company expense.","stars":4}

I sat down and tried to figure out how to log in to their computer using a credit card in order to pay an additional fee to print the label.  After five minutes of failure I left.

{"text":"Five stars for this store but Four stars for UPS lately!\n\nI got so used to going to the South Meadows store that I never realized this was here! It popped up in another search and hit my radar, so I got to check it out this morning when I had to drop off a package. \n\nSigns saying masks required, social distancing markers, plexiglas dividers, and employees masked up too, it felt like a clean and safe environment. There happened to be no one there, which definitely enhanced the experience.\n\nUPS has had higher rates and slower service lately. I think it's reasonable to expect a package shipped Monday via ground service could make its way to its destination within 5 days. It always has and it's pretty surprising they can't deliver on that now. I'm sure demand has increased, but I think it's reasonable to assume they could manage it.","stars":5}

It's not difficult and people should not be surprised when they are met resistance over their stupidity. \n\nThis is a family owned location, they are free to respond however they want to toward individuals who are rude to them & they do not exist simply to process Amazon's returns for free so there's that.","stars":5}

{"text":"This store has the WORST service you could possibly have. I came here to leave a review for others to hopefully avoid dealing with these people, and I was not surprised to find several, recent, and equally appalling reviews of this store. \n\nThe people that work here are RUDE beyond your ability to comprehend as a customer. They are truly useless largely, which I don't say lightly, as they do not even attempt to provide much of any concept of customer service. \n\nI had a package that was supposed to be delivered to my home, however UPS failed to do so, stating they attempted to do so but I was not there. I checked the cameras and that was completely untrue, for hours on either side of the time they said they attempted to deliver the package. I then was told it would be at this UPS store for me to come pick it up. \n\nAfter three days of calling UPS' 800 number to request them to redeliver the package, which each time they said they would do so and have dispatch call me, with each time neither of these occurring, I finally called the UPS store itself to confirm that the package was even there. I had to call 4 times before someone would even answer, but upon answering and met attempting to tell them my name and I am looking to see if a package was delivered to their store, the person on the phone cut me off, said \"wrong number\" and hung up. I redialed, same number, and after 4-5 more attempts, another person answered the phone, and once again before I could even get a sentence out, they said \"I will transfer you to someone that can help you\" (not even knowing what I was needing help with) and they then transferred me to the same 800 number with UPS that I had been dealing with for days. \n\nI then tried calling back over the course of the rest of the day, but after 36 attempts none of the calls were answered, so clearly they no longer wanted to deal with me, without even knowing what I was even calling about. \n\nI chose not to go to this store and interact with these people as I knew it would be useless, frustrating, and likely result in me saying something Is shouldn't, so I tried UPS corporate again, who simply didn't have any help to provide other then asking me to fill out a form for lost package, as they said they don't know where the package is in their system, despite it showing they had it.\n\nSo long story short, avoid this store at all costs. They should be punished and hopefully shut down. This is not my first interaction with them either and on all prior occasions they are extremely rude, short and don't even pay attention, in person for sure, and they clearly often don't know how to operate their own system. So safe yourself the frustration and do everyone a favor and stay away so they hopefully have some repercussion for their behavior. Unfortunately, based on past reviews and their attitude, I seriously doubt they care, as they have a built in audience with being in an office building and the only store downtown, so they have little incentive to really improve at all. \n\nSad situation.","stars":1}

Ended up explaining to her how I use to work for UPS and an posted label could be reprinted with the 1Z number which I had. She still refused/argued with me but finally decided to try and guess what it worked.

{"text":"I had a HORRENDOUS experiences at this UPS location today. An important document had been sent to this location on St. Charles Avenue for me to pick up. I received notification from UPS yesterday that it had arrived here. When I finally found the entrance to the store, several customers were lined up in line with two gentleman working behind the desk . Neither seemed to be able to successfully operate the computer system so the line was getting longer. I also noticed how that there were boxes EVERYWHERE, scattered all over. Two customers were asked to step aside when neither clerk could getting the mailing labels for their packages printed. The old short small clerk asked me \"what do you need?\". I told him I was there to pick up a package. He asked for my last name ..which I gave him...THREE TIMES. He kept looking thru a mess of scattered boxes and said \"It's not here\" . I showed him the UPS confirmation that I received from the UPS app. He said that didn't matter and the package was not here and that maybe it would show up \"tomorrow\". I asked him why I then had received the confirmation? He told me he didn't have time to \"look for that sh$%\". I was shocked. I asked him to please  look again and he told me to \"get the f*%#\" out\". I taped the entire thing on my phone. I called the UPS corporate office and was told this was a franchise and there was very little they could do. So I got online and connected with Nandi Cesarone , President of UPS America's , and Carol Tome, CEO of UPS. I have been assured that this is going to be addressed. In the meantime I strongly urge anyone needing UPS services to use an alternative location and STAY AWAY FROM The UPS Store at 201 St. Charles Ave in New Orleans.","stars":1}

I did not have my usual pleasant experience. The lady working was a bit brash - that's the best way I can say it Even in her initial greeting of \"how can I help you\" - her tone a d demeanor  were off-putting . Definitely didn't seem warm/welcoming. Maybe the busy holiday season is to blame?? \n\nAnyway, I had an item to return with a label but I made a mistake and didn't have the proper packaging to put it in. Completely my fault because I was confusing it with the returns that you don't have to package up. We had some dialogue about this I asked and if she had any extra packaging/bags that I could throw it in that weren't getting used. She looked and said she had a recycled box that she could give me for one (1) dollar.  Really? $1. That's insulting. If you have something that you were going to discard, why not give it to the customer as a favor/nice gester. Why would you charge one dollar? I'd rather you just say you don't have any.  I declined and left based on the principle. I can bring it to my other usual locations another day.","stars":1}

I took it into this store to have it sent back to Macy's. After standing in line, the little boy behind the desk scolded me in front of everybody about opening a package that was not mine. \"You are not suppose to open other people's packages!\" HUH? And then wanted to charge me shipping to ship it back to Macy's. So let me get this straight, you (UPS) delivered a package to my house that I pay the note on and you refuse to send it back to the company, so it can be redirected to the correct party.

I realize UPS stores are independently owned and each can set its own prices, but $0.94 for a metered stamp seems really high.  Then she had the nerve to tell me I was being rude to her, accusing me of snatching my receipt out of her hand.  I only wish I'd gotten this lady's name so I could include it in this review.  It may be that the UPS policy is to not accept hand-delivered letters to P.O. Boxes, but considering they'd accepted my past letters, they could have at least provided a reason for the change in policy.  Also, someone should explain to this woman that she works in customer service.  She is supposed to be friendly and amicable to her customers, not a nasty, self-righteous, stuck-up, rude witch.

The weight was about 36 pounds and the package measurement 22*18*18 (length, width and height).

I challenged it. I said on UPS site it said it will cost me $57.50. Why are you charging me $64.80?\n\nThen the lady says we automatically add one inch each side to the dimensions.

This is costing me extra $7.0 per package.\n\nThey do that to each and every unsuspecting customer to generate extra revenue for the shop.\n\nHow many people take the measurements they make for granted?

The only answer is that they are ​close and I'm in a hurry.\n\nI've wanted to move my business from another UPS location for a couple of years because this is less than a mile from my house. But literally,​ each time I go in the experience is terrible. I think they specialize in hiring unfriendly, less than helpful staff who don't know​ the first thing about customer service.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this a two star rating is because it is a UPS store and you can get those services here. If this were not a franchise and a local, homegrown​ business, they'd be out of business. But, because it is UPS people recognize the brand and they can continue to provide subpar service.\n\nFor the last month,​ I've been thinking about finally moving my PO Box from the UPS store it has been at for 8 years for the sake of convenience even knowing that the interaction with the staff at this store is less than average. After going in today for my latest transaction my decision is made. I'll keep driving​ 15 minutes to my existing store and trying to never have to go to this one again.","stars":2}
{"text":"Came in with 5 packages .  I was in and out in 5 minutes or less . A smaller lady with black hair and and an accent and an African American gentleman helped me.  Note than helpful.  Inexpensive.  This place is 5 stars thanks!!!","stars":5}
{"text":"Yet again, I had a wonderful experience at this ups location. I drive out of my way to patronize this place. Emilia was exceptionally pleasant today and processed my amazon returns with ease and expeditiousness. I really appreciate how the staff doesn't treat folks like pests.  If you have a question, they always seem to have the answer or will try to find it. The parking lot is shared with a bank...so you have to negotiate. I rarely ever have to wait. Also, try to come as prepared as you can. Make everyone's life easier (or not and they will still accommodate you). Understand that they are an all-in-one establishment. Its not only shipping, they print..do passports, have mailboxes and much more. The staff is more than willing to help.","stars":5}
{"text":"Guy working was extremely rude and swore at me during our interaction. Unbelievable. Never go here as they don't actually care and it's only a franchise so they can't be held accountable for any semblance of customer service.","stars":1}
{"text":"No do not use this store unless you have no other options, \n\nUse a better mail service they sell 24/7/365 access but only allow you access during business hours. They promise a door code which may work a few times then stop working. \n\nThey do not take their business seriously and during business hours they simply post papers on the door or window explaining sorry we are closed instead of posting that info in yelp or their website.","stars":1}
{"text":"I just left this store.  It was my first and last visit.  I would've complained about the horribly rude man behind the counter except he was the owner \n\nThe music city center has a UPS store a few blocks away. I would highly recommend only frequenting that location if you're downtown.","stars":1}
{"text":"I walked 2 miles for a notary, they were closed even though the website indicated open. A sign said \"closed due to technical difficulties\", why not let us know before we show up? Indicate on the website you are closed!","stars":1}
{"text":"So after I spent 30 minutes packing up this beautiful chair and another 15 minutes going on the UPS website to make my UPS ground with free shipping price from Largo to Alabama for $80.52 the website has me to either drop it off at the East Bay location or two other locations and since the East Bay location is less than a mile from my house I chose this one as we walk in with our large box with a gorgeous chair preciously back inside the disgruntled employee goes wait a minute I don't know if we can take that he had to call his manager he said the box was too big yet we're standing under the picture of the door advertisement touting bring a chair and will ship it to the other side of the country long story short they won't except a package it's too big the box was 34 x 27 x 40 you know the size you would have to use to pack up a nice oversize chair just like the one in their billboard advertisement hanging up in their lobby well I go back now why recommend anybody else know while I go to somewhere else absolutely","stars":1}

{"text":"I went in 2 days ago to mail a simple non-breakable piece of art (mounted on wood and no glass). Item was approx 15\"x7\"x1\" and was gift wrapped. (It did not fit in a standard sized box or I would have just gone to post office to begin with.) The guy there comes out from the back and did not want to deal with it so he pretended to measure it and said it would be $30 to pack it. I didn't flinch and said that is fine...so he proceeded to say it would be $60 to send it (going from Az to MI) for a total of $90. Literally an insane amount to spend. He told me I should just go buy a box and wrap it in a blanket and send myself. I suggested I buy the box right there and he said it would cost a lot of money to do that. I asked where I should acquire a box and he said Lowe's or U Haul. I have never come across someone more desperate to not have to do any work. Incredible! I needed up going home, ripping apart a cardboard box I had and taping it to the item. I took to USPS and priority mail was $27. The owner or this store should fire the guy--my husband told me later he knows exactly whom I had and said the others who work there are helpful.","stars":1}

{"text":"I had a (what I thought) to be complicated mailing for a TV to be serviced, and required a return label to be placed inside. After going to another mailing business and being told \"we're unable to do that here\".  I wanted to give UPS a try.  There is actually a UPS within a 5 minute drive from my home but I remember coming here previously and receiving wonderful customer service.\nThis trip was no exception.  I believe she is one of the owners, but even though the line behind me kept growing she provided amazing and patient support. \nHands down I know when I need great shipping it will be worthwhile for me to travel to the one that is a little bit further!","stars":5}
{"text":"Very happy here and the staff are always friendly. I opened a new business mailbox here and the staff made my transition super easy. They've been all smiles and super helpful. Much nicer than the government folks down the road that provide inferior service. The UPS Store has been a welcome reprieve to do business with.","stars":4}
{"text":"In the world we live in nowadays, full of dishonest humans, especially \"Porch Pirates\" as they have been labeled, I am more than thankful to have the UPS store. Having been a victim to a porch pirate, I began researching P.O. Boxes and alternatives. Unlike a P.O. Box, the UPS store has a flat rate for their mailboxes, and once you are a customer, a person will receive a plethora of services. All the \"ing\"s along with a discount for shipping packages via UPS. When I have a package delivered, I no longer have to worry about it. Aside from all the services, the best part of being a customer is the team -- a collective group of beautiful people. I really enjoy how the staff greets all their customers by name, it shows appreciation. If you are in the market for a P.O. I recommend that check with a UPS store, where a person can get a box plus much more and at a great deal!","stars":5}
{"text":"DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION!! DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT!!!!!\nResent my package to this location and they refused the package AGAIN. Package got resent to the sender the THE SECOND TIME. I went to this location myself to ask if there was a problem and everyone acted like they didn't know what was going on. An employee even \"checked in his system\" to see if anyone had refused a package and he said \"no one here refused any packages today.\" I could tell they were lying. One of the employees a pink looking tall White guy wouldn't even look my way and said loudly \"sounds suspicious\" ... and I just got the feeling everyone in the store knew exactly what was going on. Lo and behold, UPS corporate office calls me to inform me that YES, the store DID put in a request to refuse this package and they're starting a formal investigation. They don't want my business cool! Found a different UPS access point on Magazine St, with more pleasant employees and it seems to be more organized. BETTER PARKING TOO. \n\nSo, even though this store closes at 5pm, mysteriously two of my packages were refused and sent back to the merchandiser. I find this odd, seeing as I was at work at the time and could not have refused my own packages even if I wanted to. The packages were delivered to the store earlier THAT SAME DAY, July 12th and I had until July 19th to pick them up. There should be absolutely no reason why these packages should ever have been returned to the sender. One of the items is a pair of shoes that is currently sold out. Luckily I can re-order the jacket, but I am having it sent to a different store. Last time I was in here to pick up a package, it had taken the customer service reps a while to find this chic's package, as it had been mixed up with items to ship out. I could tell her blood was boiling. I should have taken that as a sign to no longer have my things shipped here. They're also closed on weekends, so I won't be able to find out who the hell sent my packages back until Monday and trust me, I will find out, because it sounds like a scam. I AM PISSED.","stars":1}

{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!\n  If you have to deal with them, pray to never have to discuss a problem.\n  There are extremely rude attendants who doesn't know about their own service. The woman lied to me, and was refusing herself to give me the service that I paid for. \n  Unfortunately, after one month, I'm still dealing with them because my package was delivered on the wrong address. I have to call them every week because they don't give me a solution.\n  I live five minutes away from their store, but I drive 15 minutes to go to the UPS Gleenbrook at Hendersonville (that is an amazing place) because I'll never give my stuff to them again. \n  There is one year since I live in the USA, and I've never experienced such a terrible customer service before.\n** I forgot to say that they are also WAY overpriced. They charged me for things that the UPS at Gleenbrook Way didn't. They charge $0.25/page printed and the other UPS charges $0.09/page printed. I spent $41 at their store, and $12 at Gleenbrook for the same service.","stars":1}
{"text":"So I googled \"passport photos near me\", Sparks UPS Store came up and their website even promotes the service and allows one to make an on-line appointment. Showed up at the appointment time, had to wait in line outside for 15 minutes due to social distancing, got inside, waited some more then when my turn came the clerk's response was \"oh, we don't do those\". This place is a joke. I can't imagine trusting them with an important package, or anything else.","stars":1}

{"text":"This store is very conveniently located closer to my house than other UPS Store options. \n\nI mailed a package from the Prince and Campbell UPS Store to my son on October 13th, 2021, who is in Army basic training in another state. \n\nOn November 3rd, 2021, I get a phone call from an associate at the store letting me know that the package was returned to the store. \n\nI asked why that would be because I've mailed him packages since September 2021 from my usual store at Wetmore in the Best Buy shopping center, and never had an issue.   She said they attempted delivery, but no one was at the house.  I let her know that my son was stationed at an army base and that her explanation doesn't make sense because there's always someone there.   I told her I'd be down to the store to discuss further and that I need to get the package to him. \n\nBefore going to the store, I looked up the delivery history from the tracking number. It showed that the delivery driver made one attempt and no one was there so they dropped my box off to a UPS Access Point and waited to see if my son would come to pick it up before returning it back to the Campbell/Prince UPS Store.\n\nFirst of all, my son is in basic training on an army base and cannot leave.  Secondly, why would they have not made 3 attempts to deliver the package?\n\nWhen I arrived at the store to discuss what transpired, the store manager Luisa was extremely dismissive. I asked her why the address was indicated as a residential address and why was only one attempt made to deliver the package?  She said that's up to UPS how they handle things. I told her that's her company,  could she look into this for me?  Again, she was dismissive and treated me like I was keeping her from something. There were only 2 customers in the store (myself and another person that was being helped by one of the other 2 associates in the store and who was not happy with the way she was being treated and overcharged)  so, I'm not sure why Luisa was treating me this way. \n\nShe said she'd be willing to ship it for me, but wouldn't cover the costs; I'd have to pay full price to ship out again.  I asked her if I could get a discount or something because this was not my fault,  I was paying for a service that was not fully accomplished by her company.  Again  she didn't care and was dismissive. I asked if we could file a claim to get my money or some of it back.  She told me she'd have to call to file it since it was sent out of her store.  I assumed she'd call them in front of me to make me confident that she was doing something about this or at least tell me that she'd contact me with a resolution.  No,  she simply walked away to the back as if I was keeping her from something vital. \n\nHer lack of customer service and dismissive attitude is the reason I left the store, drove further to the Wetmore store and sent my package from there. \n\nLuisa is in the wrong position.  She is in a customer service industry, yet shows zero care for her customers. If I was the franchise owner I would be frightened about the amount of business they're losing due to Luisa. I'm only saying this because within my visit, the only 2 customers in that store were both very unhappy with the way we were both treated (we discussed outside after exiting the store on the way to our cars). I  can't imagine how many times per day this occurs with Luisa in charge. \n\nAnyone reading this.. go to the Wetmore store between Stone and 1st. The franchise owner works out of that store, and is very nice, patient, and actually likes his customers.  He was willing to help me out with my transaction and listen to my story to ensure I wouldn't be dealing with an Access Point issue again, since I never requested that service to begin with. He did all this while there was a line of the door and didn't for one second make me feel rushed or that I was keeping him from anything.","stars":1}
